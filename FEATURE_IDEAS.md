# Bugs to fix
- [x] Only list the non-completed auto files in the read and listen page
- [x] Rework on view responsive design (using Gradio's default responsive layout)
- [x] Remain the same background color of the view for chat view
- [x] Simplify custom CSS to only include color scheme  

# Future Feature Ideas
- [ ] Autorecommendations based on transcript for next topic to study or listen to
- [ ] Add general chat questions to get the Genimi to answer instead of the transcript if needed
