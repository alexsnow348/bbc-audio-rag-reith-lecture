  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Virginia Woolf's highly influential essay on women and literature, which considers both literary history and future opportunity.  </p><p>In 1928 Woolf gave two lectures at Cambridge University about women and fiction. In front of an audience at Newnham College, she delivered the following words: “All I could do was offer you an opinion upon one minor point - a woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction; and that, as you will see, leaves the great problem of the true nature of woman and the true nature of fiction unsolved”. </p><p>These lectures formed the basis of a book she published the following year, and Woolf chose A Room Of One’s Own for its title. It is a text that set the scene for the study of women’s writing for the rest of the 20th century. Arguably, it initiated the discipline of women’s history too. </p><p>With  </p><p>Hermione Lee\nEmeritus Professor of English Literature at the University of Oxford</p><p>Michele Barrett \nEmeritus Professor of Modern Literary and Cultural Theory at Queen Mary, University of London</p><p>and</p><p>Alexandra Harris\nProfessor of English at the University of Birmingham</p><p>Producer  Luke Mulhall</p>",
