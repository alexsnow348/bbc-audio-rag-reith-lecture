  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the history of the idea of Sovereignty, the authority of a state to govern itself and the relationship between the sovereign and the people. These ideas of external and internal sovereignty were imagined in various ways in ancient Greece and Rome, and given a name in 16th Century France by the philosopher and jurist Jean Bodin in his Six Books of the Commonwealth, where he said (in an early English translation) 'Maiestie or Soveraigntie is the most high, absolute, and perpetuall power over the citisens and subiects in a Commonweale: which the Latins cal Maiestatem, the Greeks akra exousia, kurion arche, and kurion politeuma; the Italians Segnoria, and the Hebrewes tomech shévet, that is to say, The greatest power to command.' Shakespeare also explored the concept through Richard II and the king's two bodies, Hobbes developed it in the 17th Century, and the idea of popular sovereignty was tested in the Revolutionary era in America and France. </p><p>With </p><p>Melissa Lane\nClass of 1943 Professor of Politics at Princeton University</p><p>Richard Bourke\nProfessor in the History of Political Thought at Queen Mary University of London</p><p>and </p><p>Tim Stanton\nSenior Lecturer in the Department of Politics at the University of York</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>",
