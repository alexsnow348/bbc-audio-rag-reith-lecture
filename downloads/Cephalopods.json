  "description": "<p>The octopus, the squid, the nautilus and the cuttlefish are some of the most extraordinary creatures on this planet, intelligent and yet apparently unlike other life forms. They are cephalopods and are part of the mollusc family like snails and clams, and they have some characteristics in common with those. What sets them apart is the way members of their group can change colour, camouflage themselves, recognise people, solve problems, squirt ink, power themselves with jet propulsion and survive both on land, briefly, and in the deepest, coldest oceans. And, without bones or shells, they grow so rapidly they can outstrip their rivals when habitats change, making them the great survivors and adaptors of the animal world.</p><p>With</p><p>Louise Allcock\nLecturer in Zoology at the National University of Ireland, Galway</p><p>Paul Rodhouse\nEmeritus Fellow of the British Antarctic Survey</p><p>and</p><p>Jonathan Ablett\nSenior Curator of Molluscs at the Natural History Museum</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>",
