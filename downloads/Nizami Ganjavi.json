  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss one of the greatest romantic poets in Persian literature.  Nizami Ganjavi (c1141–1209) is was born in the city of Ganja in what is now Azerbaijan and his popularity soon spread throughout the Persian-speaking lands and beyond. Nizami is best known for his Khamsa, a set of five epic poems that contains a famous retelling of the tragic love story of King Khosrow II (c570-628) and the Christian princess Shirin (unknown-628) and the legend of Layla and Majnun.  Not only did he write romances: his poetry also displays a dazzling knowledge of philosophy, astronomy, botany and the life of Alexander the Great.</p><p>With </p><p>Christine van Ruymbeke\nProfessor of Persian Literature and Culture at the University of Cambridge</p><p>Narguess Farzad\nSenior Lecturer in Persian Studies at SOAS, University of London</p><p>And</p><p>Dominic Parviz Brookshaw\nProfessor of Persian Literature and Iranian Culture at the University of Oxford</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>Reading list:</p><p>Laurence Binyon, The Poems of Nizami (The Studio Limited, 1928)</p><p>Barbara Brend, Treasures of Herat: Two Manuscripts of the Khamsah of Nizami in the British Library (Gingko, 2020)</p><p>Barbara Brend, The Emperor Akbar’s Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, 1995)</p><p>J-C.
