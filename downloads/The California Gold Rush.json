In 1849 the recent discovery of gold at Coloma, near Sacramento in California, led to a massive influx of prospectors seeking to make their fortunes. Within a couple of years the tiny settlement of San Francisco had become a major city, with tens of thousands of immigrants, the so-called Forty-Niners, arriving by boat and over land. The gold rush transformed the west coast of America and its economy, but also uprooted local populations of Native Americans and made irreversible changes to natural habitats.</p><p>With:</p><p>Kathleen Burk\nProfessor of Modern and Contemporary History at University College London</p><p>Jacqueline Fear-Segal\nReader in American History and Culture at the University of East Anglia</p><p>Frank Cogliano\nProfessor of American History at the University of Edinburgh.</p>",
