  "title": "Alexander the Great",
  "description": "<p>Alexander the Great is one of the most celebrated military commanders in history. Born into the Macedonian royal family in 356 BC, he gained control of Greece and went on to conquer the Persian Empire, defeating its powerful king, Darius III. At its peak, Alexander's empire covered modern Turkey, Syria, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan and part of India. As a result, Greek culture and language was spread into regions it had not penetrated before, and he is also remembered for founding a number of cities. Over the last 2,000 years, the legend of Alexander has grown and he has influenced numerous generals and politicians.</p><p>With:</p><p>Paul Cartledge\nEmeritus Professor of Greek Culture and AG Leventis Senior Research Fellow at Clare College, University of Cambridge</p><p>Diana Spencer\nProfessor of Classics at the University of Birmingham</p><p>Rachel Mairs\nLecturer in Classics at the University of Reading</p><p>Producer: Victoria Brignell.</p>",
