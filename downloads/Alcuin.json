  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Alcuin of York, c735-804AD, who promoted education as a goal in itself, and had a fundamental role in the renaissance at Charlemagne's court. He wrote poetry and many letters, hundreds of which survive and provide insight into his life and times. He was born in or near York and spent most of his life in Northumbria before accepting an invitation to Charlemagne's court in Aachen. To this he brought Anglo-Saxon humanism, encouraging a broad liberal education for itself and the better to understand Christian doctrine. He left to be abbot at Marmoutier, Tours, where the monks were developing the Carolingian script that influenced the Roman typeface. </p><p>The image above is Alcuin’s portrait, found in a copy of the Bible made at his monastery in Tours during the rule of his successor Abbot Adalhard (834–843).  Painted in red on gold leaf, it shows Alcuin with a tonsure and a halo, signifying respect for his memory at the monastery where he had died in 804.  His name and rank are spelled out alongside: Alcvinvs abba, ‘Alcuin the abbot’.  It is held at the Staatsbibliothek Bamberg -Kaiser-Heinrich-Bibliothek - Msc.Bibl.1,fol.5v (photo by Gerald Raab).</p><p>With </p><p>Joanna Story\nProfessor of Early Medieval History at the University of Leicester</p><p>Andy Orchard\nRawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon at the University of Oxford and a fellow of Pembroke College</p><p>And  </p><p>Mary Garrison\nLecturer in History at the Centre for Medieval Studies at the University of York</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
