  "title": "The Gin Craze",
  "description": "<p>In a programme first broadcast in December 2016, Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the craze for gin in Britain in the mid-18th century and the attempts to control it.  With the arrival of William of Orange, it became an act of loyalty to drink Protestant, Dutch gin rather than Catholic brandy, and changes in tariffs made everyday beer less affordable. Within a short time, production increased and  large sections of the population that had rarely or never drunk spirits before were consuming two pints of gin a week. As Hogarth indicated in his print 'Beer Street and Gin Lane' (1751) in support of the Gin Act, the damage was severe, and addiction to gin was blamed for much of the crime in cities such as London. </p><p>With </p><p>Angela McShane\nResearch Fellow in History at the Victoria and Albert Museum and University of Sheffield</p><p>Judith Hawley\nProfessor of 18th century literature at Royal Holloway, University of London</p><p>Emma Major\nSenior Lecturer in English at the University of York</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
