  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Euripides' great tragedy, which was first performed in Athens in 405 BC when the Athenians were on the point of defeat and humiliation in a long war with Sparta. The action seen or described on stage was brutal:  Pentheus, king of Thebes, is torn into pieces by his mother in a Bacchic frenzy and his grandparents condemned to crawl away as snakes.  All this happened because Pentheus had denied the divinity of his cousin Dionysus, known to the audience as god of wine, theatre, fertility and religious ecstasy. </p><p>The image above is a detail of a Red-Figure Cup showing the death of Pentheus (exterior) and a Maenad (interior), painted c. 480 BC by the Douris painter. This object can be found at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas.</p><p>With </p><p>Edith Hall\nProfessor of Classics at King’s College London</p><p>Emily Wilson\nProfessor of Classical Studies at the University of Pennsylvania</p><p>And</p><p>Rosie Wyles\nLecturer in Classical History and Literature at the University of Kent</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
