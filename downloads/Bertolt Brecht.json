  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss one of the greatest European playwrights of the twentieth century. The aim of Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956) was to make the familiar ‘strange’: with plays such as Mother Courage and The Caucasian Chalk Circle he wanted his audience not to sit back but to engage, observe and  discover the contradictions in life, and act on what they learnt.  He developed this approach in turbulent times, from Weimar Germany to the rise of the Nazis, to exile in Scandinavia and America and then post-war life in East Berlin, and he has since inspired dramatists around the world.</p><p>With</p><p>Laura Bradley\nProfessor of German and Theatre at the University of Edinburgh</p><p>David Barnett\nProfessor of Theatre at the University of York</p><p>And </p><p>Tom Kuhn\nProfessor of Twentieth Century German Literature, Emeritus Fellow of St Hugh's College, University of Oxford</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson\nIn Our Time is a BBC Studios Audio production</p><p>Reading list: </p><p>David Barnett, Brecht in Practice: Theatre, Theory and Performance (Bloomsbury, 2014)</p><p>David Barnett, A History of the Berliner Ensemble (Cambridge University Press, 2015)</p><p>Laura Bradley and Karen Leeder (eds.), Brecht and the GDR: Politics, Culture, Posterity (Camden House, 2015)</p><p>Laura Bradley, ‘Training the Audience: Brecht and the Art of Spectatorship’ (The Modern Language Review, 111, 2016)</p><p>Bertolt Brecht (ed.
