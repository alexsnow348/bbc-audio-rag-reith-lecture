  "description": "<p>Jonathan Sumption argues that judges - especially those of the European Court of Human Rights - have usurped power by expanding the interpretation of human rights law. Lord Sumption argues that concepts of human rights have a long history in the common law. But by contrast, the European Convention on Human Rights has become a dynamic treaty, taking on new interpretations and powers. Article 8 – the right to private and family life – is the most striking example.  Should these decisions be made by judges or parliament? The lecture is recorded before an audience in the old Parliament House in Edinburgh.  </p><p>The Reith Lectures are presented and chaired by Anita Anand and produced by Jim Frank.  \nEditor: Hugh Levinson</p>",
