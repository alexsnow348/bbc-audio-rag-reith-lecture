  "title": "1. Freedom of Speech",
  "description": "<p>Best-selling Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie gives the first of four 2022 Reith Lectures, discussing freedom of speech.  She argues that it feels like freedom of speech is under attack. Cancel culture, arguments about “wokeness\" and the assault on Salman Rushdie have produced a febrile atmosphere. Meanwhile autocrats and populists have undermined the very notion of an accepted fact-based truth which lives above politics. So how do we calibrate freedom in this context?  If we have the freedom to offend, where do we draw the line? This lecture and question-and-answer session is recorded in London in front of an audience and presented by Anita Anand.</p><p>The year's series was inspired by President Franklin D Roosevelt's four freedoms speech of 1941 and asks what this terrain means now? \nIt features four different lecturers. In addition to Chimamanda, they are:  \nFreedom of Worship by Rowan Williams \nFreedom from Want by Darren McGarvey \nFreedom from Fear by Fiona Hill</p><p>Producer: Jim Frank  \nSound Engineers: Rod Farquhar and Neil Churchill \nProduction Coordinator: Brenda Brown \nEditor: Hugh Levinson</p>",
