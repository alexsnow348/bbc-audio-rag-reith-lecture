  "description": "<p>\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\" So begins Emma by Jane Austen, describing her leading character who, she said, was \"a heroine whom no-one but myself will much like.\" Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss this, one of Austen's most popular novels and arguably her masterpiece, a brilliantly sparkling comedy of manners published in December 1815 by John Murray, the last to be published in Austen's lifetime. This followed Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813) and Mansfield Park (1814), with her brother Henry handling publication of Northanger Abbey and Persuasion (1817). </p><p>With </p><p>Janet Todd\nProfessor Emerita of Literature, University of Aberdeen and Honorary Fellow of Newnham College, Cambridge</p><p>John Mullan\nProfessor of English at University College, London</p><p>And</p><p>Emma Clery\nProfessor of English at the University of Southampton.</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>",
