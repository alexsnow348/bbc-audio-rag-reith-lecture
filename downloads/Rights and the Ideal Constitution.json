  "description": "<p>Jonathan Sumption assesses the US and UK’s constitutional models. He describes Britain's unwritten constitution as a political institution. The US Constitution is by contrast essentially a legal document.  This has led Americans to address what should be political questions – such as the right to abortion – via the courts, rather than through politics. Britain, Lord Sumption argues, should learn from the United States be careful about which rights should be put beyond democratic choice. </p><p>The programme is recorded in front of an audience at George Washington University in Washington DC.   </p><p>The Reith Lectures are presented and chaired by Anita Anand and produced by Jim Frank.  \nEditor: Hugh Levinson</p>",
