  "description": "<p>This year's BBC Reith Lecturer is Ben Ansell, Professor of Comparative Democratic Institutions at Nuffield College, Oxford University and  author of “Why Politics Fails.”  \nIn four lectures called “Our Democratic Future,” he asks how we can build a politics that works for all of us with political systems which are robust to the challenges of the twenty first century, from climate change to artificial intelligence.  </p><p>In this fourth and final lecture, recorded in Atlanta, Georgia in the United States, he interrogates a crucial question: can we continue to grow our economies without despoiling the earth?  Focusing on the existential threats created by our own innovation - from climate change to out-of-control artificial intelligence – Ansell asks whether our politics is up to the task of supporting sustainable growth. </p><p>The Reith Lectures are chaired by Anita Anand and produced by Jim Frank. \nThe Editors are China Collins and Clare Fordham, and the co-ordinator is Brenda Brown. \nThe series is mixed by Rod Farquhar and Neil Churchill.</p>",
