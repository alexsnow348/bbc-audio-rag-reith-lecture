  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Aristotle's ideas on what happiness means and how to live a good life. Aristotle (384-322BC) explored these almost two and a half thousand years ago in what became known as his Nicomachean Ethics. His audience then were the elite in Athens as, he argued, if they knew how to live  their lives well then they could better rule the lives of others. While circumstances and values have changed across the centuries, Aristotle's approach to answering those questions has fascinated philosophers ever since and continues to do so.</p><p>With </p><p>Angie Hobbs\nProfessor of the Public Understanding of Philosophy at the University of Sheffield</p><p>Roger Crisp\nDirector of the Oxford Uehiro Centre for Practical Ethics, Professor of Moral Philosophy and Tutor in Philosophy at St Anne’s College, University of Oxford</p><p>And </p><p>Sophia Connell\nSenior Lecturer in Philosophy at Birkbeck, University of London</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>Reading list:</p><p>J.L.
