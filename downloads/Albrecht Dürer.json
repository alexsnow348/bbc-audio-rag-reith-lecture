  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the great German artist Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528) who achieved fame throughout Europe for the power of his images. These range from his woodcut of a rhinoceros, to his watercolour of a young hare, to his drawing of praying hands and his stunning self-portraits such as that above (albeit here in a later monochrome reproduction) with his distinctive A D monogram.  He was expected to follow his father and become a goldsmith, but found his own way to be a great artist, taking public commissions that built his reputation but did not pay, while creating a market for his prints, and he captured the timeless and the new in a world of great change.</p><p>With </p><p>Susan Foister\nDeputy Director and Curator of German Paintings at the National Gallery</p><p>Giulia Bartrum\nFreelance art historian and Former Curator of German Prints and Drawings at the British Museum</p><p>And</p><p>Ulinka Rublack\nProfessor of Early Modern European History and Fellow of St John’s College, University of Cambridge</p><p>Studio production: John Goudie</p>",
