  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the life of Spartacus, the gladiator who led a major slave rebellion against the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC. He was an accomplished military leader, and the campaign he led contributed significantly to the instability of the Roman state in this period. Spartacus was celebrated by some ancient historians and reviled by others, and became a hero to revolutionaries in 19th-century Europe. Modern perceptions of his character have been influenced by Stanley Kubrick's 1960 film - but ancient sources give a rather more complex picture of Spartacus and the aims of his rebellion.</p><p>With:</p><p>Mary Beard\nProfessor of Classics at the University of Cambridge</p><p>Maria Wyke\nProfessor of Latin at University College, London</p><p>Theresa Urbainczyk\nAssociate Professor of Classics at University College, Dublin.</p><p>Producer: Victoria Brignell.</p>",
