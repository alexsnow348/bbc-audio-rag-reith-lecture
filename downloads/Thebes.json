  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the myths and history of the ancient Greek city of Thebes and its depiction in Athenian drama. In myths it was said to be home to Heracles, Dionysus, Oedipus and Cadmus among others and, in history, was infamous for supporting Xerxes in the Persian War. Its prominence led to a struggle with the rising force of Macedon in which the Thebans were defeated at Chaironea in 338 BC, one of the most important battles in ancient history. The position of Thebes in Greek culture was enormously powerful. The strength of its myths and its proximity to Athens made it a source of stories for the Athenian theatre, and is the setting for more of the surviving plays than any other location. </p><p>The image, above, is of Oedipus answering questions of the sphinx in Thebes (cup 5th century BC).</p><p>With </p><p>Edith Hall\nProfessor of Classics at King's College London</p><p>Samuel Gartland\nLecturer in Ancient History at Corpus Christi College, University of Oxford</p><p>and</p><p>Paul Cartledge\nEmeritus Professor of Greek Culture and AG Leventis Senior Research Fellow at Clare College, University of Cambridge</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>",
