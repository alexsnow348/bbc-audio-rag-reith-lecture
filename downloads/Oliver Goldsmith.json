  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the renowned and versatile Irish writer Oliver Goldsmith (1728 - 1774). There is a memorial to him in Westminster Abbey’s Poet’s Corner written by Dr Johnson, celebrating Goldsmith's life as a poet, natural philosopher and historian. To this could be added ‘playwright’ and ‘novelist’ and ‘science writer’ and ‘pamphleteer’ and much besides, as Goldsmith explored so many different outlets for his talents.  While he began on Grub Street in London, the centre for jobbing writers scrambling for paid work, he became a great populariser and compiler of new ideas and knowledge and achieved notable successes with poems such as The Deserted Village, his play She Stoops to Conquer and his short novel The Vicar of Wakefield. </p><p>With</p><p>David O’Shaughnessy\nProfessor of Eighteenth-Century Studies at the University of Galway</p><p>Judith Hawley\nProfessor of Eighteenth-Century Literature at Royal Holloway, University of London</p><p>And </p><p>Michael Griffin\nProfessor of English at the University of Limerick</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>Reading list:</p><p>Norma Clarke, Brothers of the Quill: Oliver Goldsmith in Grub Street (Harvard University Press, 2016)</p><p>Leo Damrosch, The Club: Johnson, Boswell, and the Friends Who Shaped an Age (Yale University Press, 2019)</p><p>Oliver Goldsmith (ed.
