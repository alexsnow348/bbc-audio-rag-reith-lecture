  "description": "<p>In this 900th edition of the programme, Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss one of the best known and most influential of the poems of the Romantic movement.  Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772-1834) wrote The Rime of the Ancient Mariner in 1798 after discussions with his friend Wordsworth.  He refined it for the rest of his life, and it came to define him, a foreshadowing of his opium-addicted, lonely wandering and deepening sense of guilt. The poem tells of a sailor compelled to tell and retell the story of a terrible voyage in his youth, this time as guests are heading to a wedding party, where he stoppeth one of three.</p><p>The image above is from Gustave Doré's illustration of the mariner's shooting of the albatross, for an 1877 German language edition of the poem</p><p>With</p><p>Sir Jonathan Bate\nProfessor of Environmental Humanities at Arizona State University</p><p>Tom Mole\nProfessor of English Literature and Book History at the University of Edinburgh</p><p>And </p><p>Rosemary Ashton\nEmeritus Quain Professor of English Language and Literature at University College London</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
