  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the Danish prince who became a very effective King of England in 1016.  </p><p>Cnut inherited a kingdom in a sorry state. The north and east coast had been harried by Viking raiders, and his predecessor King Æthelred II had struggled to maintain order amongst the Anglo-Saxon nobility too. Cnut proved to be skilful ruler. Not only did he bring stability and order to the kingdom, he exported the Anglo-Saxon style of centralised government to Denmark. Under Cnut, England became the cosmopolitan centre of a multi-national North Atlantic Empire, and a major player in European politics. </p><p>With </p><p>Erin Goeres\nAssociate Professor of Old Norse Language and Literature at University College London</p><p>Pragya Vohra\nLecturer in Medieval History at the University of York</p><p>and </p><p>Elizabeth Tyler\nProfessor of Medieval Literature and Co-Director of the Centre for Medieval Studies at the University of York </p><p>Producer  Luke Mulhall</p>",
