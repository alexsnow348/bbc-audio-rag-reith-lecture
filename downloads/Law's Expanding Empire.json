  "title": "Law's Expanding Empire",
  "description": "<p>Jonathan Sumption argues that the law is taking over the space once occupied by politics. Lord Sumption was until recently a justice of the UK’s Supreme Court, as well as being a distinguished historian. In this lecture, recorded before an audience at Middle Temple in London, Lord Sumption says that until the 19th century, law only dealt with a narrow range of human problems.  That has now changed radically.  And he argues that the growth of the law, driven by demand for greater personal security and less risk, means we have less liberty.\nThe Reith Lectures are presented and chaired by Anita Anand and produced by Jim Frank \nEditor: Hugh Levinson</p>",
