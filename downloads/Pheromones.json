Pheromones are used by species across the animal kingdom in a variety of ways, such as laying trails to be followed, to raise the alarm, to scatter from predators, to signal dominance and to enhance attractiveness and, in honey bees, even direct development into queen or worker. </p><p>The image above is of male and female ladybirds that have clustered together in response to pheromones. </p><p>With </p><p>Tristram Wyatt\nSenior Research Fellow at the Department of Zoology at the University of Oxford</p><p>Jane Hurst\nWilliam Prescott Professor of Animal Science at the University of Liverpool</p><p>and </p><p>Francis Ratnieks\nProfessor of Apiculture and Head of the Laboratory of Apiculture and Social Insects at the University of Sussex</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
