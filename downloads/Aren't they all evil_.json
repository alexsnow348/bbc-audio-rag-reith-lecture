  "description": "<p>In her second Reith Lecture, Dr Gwen Adshead asks if there’s such a thing as “evil.”? \nIn a career spanning nearly 40 years the forensic psychiatrist has heard many of her patients ask: “ I have done evil things but does that make me evil.”? \nDr Adshead says that we have often confused “evil” with mental illness.  She argues that we all have capacity for “evil” and says we need to find ways to cultivate societal and individual  “goodness.” \nThe programme is recorded at the V&amp;A in Dundee in front of an audience. \nThe Reith Lectures are presented and chaired by Anita Anand. \nProducer: Jim Frank\nEditor: Clare Fordham</p>",
