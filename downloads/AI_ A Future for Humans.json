  "description": "<p>Stuart Russell suggests a way forward for human control over super-powerful artificial intelligence. He argues for the abandonment of the current “standard model” of AI, proposing instead a new model based on three principles - chief among them the idea that machines should know that they don’t know what humans’ true objectives are. Echoes of the new model are already found in phenomena as diverse as menus, market research, and democracy. Machines designed according to the new model would be, Russell suggests, deferential to humans, cautious and minimally invasive in their behaviour and, crucially, willing to be switched off. He will conclude by exploring further the consequences of success in AI for our future as a species.</p><p>Stuart Russell is Professor of Computer Science and founder of the Center for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p>The programme and question-and-answer session was recorded at the National Innovation Centre for Data in Newcastle Upon Tyne.\nPresenter: Anita Anand \nProducer: Jim Frank\nProduction Coordinator: Brenda Brown\nEditor: Hugh Levinson.</p>",
