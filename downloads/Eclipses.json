  "description": "<p>To celebrate Melvyn Bragg’s 27 years presenting In Our Time, five well-known fans of the programme have chosen their favourite episodes. Guy Garvey, lyricist and lead singer of the band Elbow, has selected the episode on eclipses, first broadcast in December 2020. Solar eclipses are some of life’s most extraordinary moments, when day becomes night and the stars come out before day returns either all too soon or not soon enough, depending on what you understand to be happening. In ancient China, for example, there was a story that a dragon was eating the sun and it had to be scared away by banging pots and pans if the sun were to return. Total lunar eclipses are more frequent and last longer, with a blood moon coloured red like a sunrise or sunset. Both events have created the chance for scientists to learn something remarkable, from the speed of light, to the width of the Atlantic, to the roundness of the Earth, to discovering helium and proving Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity.</p><p>With </p><p>Carolin Crawford\nPublic Astronomer based at the Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge and a fellow of Emmanuel College</p><p>Frank Close\nEmeritus Professor of Physics at the University of Oxford</p><p>And</p><p>Lucie Green\nProfessor of Physics and a Royal Society University Research Fellow at Mullard Space Science Laboratory at University College London</p><p>Producers: Simon Tillotson and Julia Johnson</p><p>Spanning history, religion, culture, science and philosophy, In Our Time from BBC Radio 4 is essential listening for the intellectually curious.
