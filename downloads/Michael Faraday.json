  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the eminent 19th-century scientist Michael Faraday. Born into a poor working-class family, he received little formal schooling but became interested in science while working as a bookbinder's apprentice. He is celebrated today for carrying out pioneering research into the relationship between electricity and magnetism. Faraday showed that if a wire was turned in the presence of a magnet or a magnet was turned in relation to a wire, an electric current was generated. This ground-breaking discovery led to the development of the electric generator and ultimately to modern power stations. During his life he became the most famous scientist in Britain and he played a key role in founding the Royal Institution's Christmas lectures which continue today.</p><p>With:</p><p>Geoffrey Cantor\nProfessor Emeritus of the History of Science at the University of Leeds</p><p>Laura Herz\nProfessor of Physics at the University of Oxford</p><p>Frank James\nProfessor of the History of Science at the Royal Institution</p><p>Producer: Victoria Brignell.</p>",
