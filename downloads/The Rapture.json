  "title": "The Rapture",
  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas developed by the Anglican priest John Nelson Darby (1800-1882), drawn from his reading of scripture, in which Jesus would suddenly take His believers up into the air, and those left behind would suffer on Earth until He returned with His church to rule for a thousand years before Final Judgement.  Some believers would look for signs that civilization was declining, such as wars and natural disasters, or for new Roman Empires that would harbour the Antichrist, and from these predict the time of the Rapture.  Darby helped establish the Plymouth Brethren, and later his ideas were picked up in the Scofield Reference Bible (1909) and soon became influential, particularly in the USA.  </p><p>With </p><p>Elizabeth Phillips\nResearch Fellow at the Margaret Beaufort Institute at the University of Cambridge and Honorary Fellow in the Department of Theology and Religion at Durham University</p><p>Crawford Gribben\nProfessor of Early Modern British History at Queen’s University Belfast</p><p>and </p><p>Nicholas Guyatt\nReader in North American History at the University of Cambridge</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
