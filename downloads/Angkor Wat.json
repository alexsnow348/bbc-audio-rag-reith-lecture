  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the largest and arguably the most astonishing religious structure on Earth, built for Suryavarman II in the 12th Century in modern-day Cambodia. It is said to have more stone in it than the Great Pyramid of Giza, and much of the surface is intricately carved and remarkably well preserved. For the last 900 years Angkor Wat has been a centre of religion, whether Hinduism, Buddhism or Animism or a combination of those, and a source of wonder to Cambodians and visitors from around the world.</p><p>With</p><p>Piphal Heng\nPostdoctoral scholar at the Cotsen Institute and the Programme for Early Modern Southeast Asia at UCLA</p><p>Ashley Thompson\nHiram W Woodward Chair of Southeast Asian Art at SOAS University of London</p><p>And</p><p>Simon Warrack\nA stone conservator who has worked extensively at Angkor Wat</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
