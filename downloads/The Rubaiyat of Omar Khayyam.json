  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. In 1859 the poet Edward FitzGerald published a long poem based on the verses of the 11th-century Persian scholar Omar Khayyam. Not a single copy was sold in the first few months after the work's publication, but after it came to the notice of members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood it became enormously influential. Although only loosely based on the original, the Rubaiyat made Khayyam the best-known Eastern poet in the English-speaking world. FitzGerald's version is itself one of the most admired works of Victorian literature, praised and imitated by many later writers.</p><p>With:</p><p>Charles Melville\nProfessor of Persian History at the University of Cambridge</p><p>Daniel Karlin\nWinterstoke Professor of English Literature at the University of Bristol</p><p>Kirstie Blair\nProfessor of English Studies at the University of Stirling</p><p>Producer: Thomas Morris.</p>",
