  "description": "<p>Dr Steve Jones, Reader in Genetics at University College, London gives a series of lectures on the new biological insight into humanity.</p><p>In his second lecture, Dr Jones explores the importance of mutation in the development of individuals and species. Recent advances in molecular biology have revolutionised the study of mutations in human DNA.</p><p>Dr Jones explains how mutation leads to diversity and change, some good, some bad, and argues that humanity is not a decayed remnant of a noble ancestor, but rather we are the products of evolution; a set of successful mistakes.</p>",
