  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the ideas and life of the German theologian, born in Breslau/Wroclaw in 1906 and killed in the Flossenbürg concentration camp on 9th April 1945. Bonhoeffer developed ideas about the role of the Church in the secular world, in particular Germany after the Nazis took power in 1933 and demanded the Churches' support. He strongly opposed anti-Semitism and, with a role in the Military Intelligence Department, took part in the resistance, plotting to kill Hitler and meeting with contacts in the Allies. Bonhoeffer's ideas on Christian ethics and the relationship between Christianity and humanism spread more widely from the 1960s with the discovery of unpublished works, including those written in prison as he awaited execution.</p><p>With </p><p>Stephen Plant\nDean and Runcie Fellow at Trinity Hall at the University of Cambridge</p><p>Eleanor McLaughlin\nLecturer in Theology and Ethics at the University of Winchester and Lecturer in Ethics at Regent’s Park College at the University of Oxford</p><p>And </p><p>Tom Greggs\nMarischal Chair of Divinity at the University of Aberdeen</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
