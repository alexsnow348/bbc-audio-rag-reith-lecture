  "title": "The Proton",
  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the discovery and growing understanding of the Proton, formed from three quarks close to the Big Bang and found in the nuclei of all elements. The positive charges they emit means they attract the fundamental particles of negatively charged electrons, an attraction that leads to the creation of atoms which in turn leads to chemistry, biology and life itself. The Sun (in common with other stars) is a fusion engine that turn protons by a series of processes into helium, emitting energy in the process, with about half of the Sun's protons captured so far. Hydrogen atoms, stripped of electrons, are single protons which can be accelerated to smash other nuclei and have applications in proton therapy. Many questions remain, such as why are electrical charges for protons and electrons so perfectly balanced?</p><p>With</p><p>Frank Close\nProfessor Emeritus of Physics at the University of Oxford</p><p>Helen Heath\nReader in Physics at the University of Bristol</p><p>And</p><p>Simon Jolly\nLecturer in High Energy Physics at University College London</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>",
