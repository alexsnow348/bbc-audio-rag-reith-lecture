  "description": "<p>In 1957 Stevie Smith published a poetry collection called Not Waving But Drowning – and its title poem gave us a phrase which has entered the language. </p><p>Its success has overshadowed her wider work as the author of more than half a dozen collections of poetry and three novels, mostly written while she worked as a secretary. Her poems, printed with her pen and ink sketches, can seem simple and comical, but often beneath the surface lurk themes of melancholy, loneliness, love and death.  </p><p>With \nJeremy Noel-Tod\nAssociate Professor in the School of Literature, Drama and Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia </p><p>Noreen Masud \nLecturer in Twentieth Century Literature at the University of Bristol </p><p>and </p><p>Will May \nProfessor of Modern and Contemporary Literature at the University of Southampton</p><p>The photograph above shows Stevie Smith recording her story Sunday at Home, a finalist in the BBC Third Programme Short Story competition in 1949.</p>",
