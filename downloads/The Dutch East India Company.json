The VOC dominated the spice trade between Asia and Europe for two hundred years, with the British East India Company a distant second. At its peak, the VOC had a virtual monopoly on nutmeg, mace, cloves and cinnamon, displacing the Portuguese and excluding the British, and were the only European traders allowed access to Japan.</p><p>With </p><p>Anne Goldgar\nReader in Early Modern European History at King's College London</p><p>Chris Nierstrasz\nLecturer in Global History at Erasmus University, Rotterdam, formerly at the University of Warwick</p><p>And</p><p>Helen Paul\nLecturer in Economics and Economic History at the University of Southampton</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>",
