  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the science of matter and the states in which it can exist. Most people are familiar with the idea that a substance like water can exist in solid, liquid and gaseous forms. But as much as 99% of the matter in the universe is now believed to exist in a fourth state, plasma. Today scientists recognise a number of other exotic states or phases, such as glasses, gels and liquid crystals - many of them with useful properties that can be exploited.</p><p>With:</p><p>Andrea Sella\nProfessor of Chemistry at University College London</p><p>Athene Donald\nProfessor of Experimental Physics at the University of Cambridge</p><p>Justin Wark\nProfessor of Physics and Fellow of Trinity College at the University of Oxford</p><p>Producer: Thomas Morris.</p>",
