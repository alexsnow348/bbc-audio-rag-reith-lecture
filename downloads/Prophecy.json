Prophets, those with the ability to convey divinely-inspired revelation, are significant figures in the Hebrew Bible and later became important not just to Judaism but also to Christianity and Islam. Although these three religions share many of the same prophets, their interpretation of the nature of prophecy often differs.</p><p>With:</p><p>Mona Siddiqui\nProfessor of Islamic and Interreligious Studies at the University of Edinburgh</p><p>Justin Meggitt\nUniversity Senior Lecturer in the Study of Religion and the Origins of Christianity at the University of Cambridge</p><p>Jonathan Stökl\nPost-Doctoral Researcher at Leiden University.</p><p>Producer: Thomas Morris.</p>",
