  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss one of the most energetic, varied and innovative playwrights of his time. Thomas Middleton (1580-1627) worked across the London stages both alone and with others from Dekker and Rowley to Shakespeare and more.  Middleton’s range included raucous city comedies such as A Chaste Maid in Cheapside and chilling revenge tragedies like The Changeling and The Revenger’s Tragedy, some with the main adult companies and some with child actors playing the scheming adults.  Middleton seemed to be everywhere on the Jacobean stage, mixing warmth and cruelty amid laughter and horror, and even Macbeth’s witches may be substantially his work.</p><p>With</p><p>Emma Smith\nProfessor of Shakespeare Studies at Hertford College, University of Oxford</p><p>Lucy Munro\nProfessor of Shakespeare and Early Modern Literature at Kings College London</p><p>And </p><p>Michelle O’Callaghan\nProfessor of Early Modern Literature at the University of Reading</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>Reading list:</p><p>Swapan Chakravorty, Society and Politics in the Plays of Thomas Middleton (Clarendon Press, 1996)</p><p>Suzanne Gossett (ed.), Thomas Middleton in Context (Cambridge University Press, 2011)</p><p>R.V.
