  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the doctrine of Karma as developed initially among Hindus, Jains and Buddhists in India from the first millennium BCE.  Common to each is an idea, broadly, that you reap what you sow: how you act in this world has consequences either for your later life or your future lives, depending on your view of rebirth and transmigration.  From this flow different ideas including those about free will, engagement with the world or disengagement, the nature of ethics and whether intention matters, and these ideas continue to develop today.</p><p>With </p><p>Monima Chadha\nProfessor of Indian Philosophy and Tutorial Fellow at Lady Margaret Hall, University of Oxford</p><p>Jessica Frazier\nLecturer in the Study of Religion at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies</p><p>And</p><p>Karen O’Brien-Kop\nLecturer in Asian Religions at Kings College London</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>In Our Time is a BBC Studios Audio Production</p><p>Reading list:</p><p>J.
