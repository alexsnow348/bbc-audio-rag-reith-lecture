  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Berlin Conference of 1884. In the 1880s, as colonial powers attempted to increase their spheres of influence in Africa, tensions began to grow between European nations including Britain, Belgium and France. In 1884 the German Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, brought together many of Europe's leading statesmen to discuss trade and colonial activities in Africa. Although the original purpose of the summit was to settle the question of territorial rights in West Africa, negotiations eventually dealt with the entire continent. The conference was part of the process known as the Scramble for Africa, and the decisions reached at it had effects which have lasted to the present day. The conference is commonly seen as one of the most significant events of the so-called Scramble for Africa; in the following decades, European nations laid claim to most of the continent.</p><p>With:</p><p>Richard Drayton\nRhodes Professor of Imperial History at King's College London</p><p>Richard Rathbone\nEmeritus Professor of African History at SOAS, University of London</p><p>Joanna Lewis\nAssistant Professor of Imperial History at the LSE, University of London.</p><p>Producer: Thomas Morris.</p>",
