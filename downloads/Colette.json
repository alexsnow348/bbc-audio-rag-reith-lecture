  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss  one of the outstanding French writers of the twentieth century.  The novels of Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette (1873 - 1954) always had women at their centre, from youth to mid-life to old age, and they were phenomenally popular, at first for their freshness and frankness about women’s lives, as in the Claudine stories, and soon for their sheer quality as she developed as a writer.  Throughout her career she intrigued readers by inserting herself, or a character with her name, into her works, fictionalising her life as a way to share her insight into the human experience.</p><p>With </p><p>Diana Holmes\nProfessor of French at the University of Leeds</p><p>Michèle Roberts\nWriter, novelist, poet and Emeritus Professor of Creative Writing at the University of East Anglia</p><p>And</p><p>Belinda Jack\nFellow and Tutor in French Literature and Language at Christ Church, University of Oxford</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
