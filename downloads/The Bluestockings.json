  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Bluestockings. Around the middle of the eighteenth century a small group of intellectual women began to meet regularly to discuss literature and other matters, inviting some of the leading thinkers of the day to take part in informal salons. In an age when women were not expected to be highly educated, the Bluestockings were sometimes regarded with suspicion or even hostility. But prominent members such as Elizabeth Montagu - known as 'the Queen of the Bluestockings', and author of an influential essay about Shakespeare - and the classicist Elizabeth Carter were highly regarded for their scholarship. Their accomplishments led to far greater acceptance of women as the intellectual equal of men, and furthered the cause of female education.</p><p>With:</p><p>Karen O'Brien\nVice-Principal and Professor of English at King's College London</p><p>Elizabeth Eger\nReader in English Literature at King's College London</p><p>Nicole Pohl\nReader in English Literature at Oxford Brookes University</p><p>Producer: Thomas Morris.</p>",
