  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the discovery in 1922 of Tutankhamun's 3000 year old tomb and its impact on the understanding of ancient Egypt, both academic and popular. The riches, such as the death mask above, were spectacular and made the reputation of Howard Carter who led the excavation.  And if the astonishing contents of the tomb were not enough, the drama of the find and the control of how it was reported led to a craze for 'King Tut' that has rarely subsided and has enthused and sometimes confused people around the world, seeking to understand the reality of Tutankhamun's life and times.</p><p>With </p><p>Elizabeth Frood\nAssociate Professor of Egyptology, Director of the Griffith Institute and Fellow of St Cross at the University of Oxford</p><p>Christina Riggs\nProfessor of the History of Visual Culture at Durham University and a Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford</p><p>And </p><p>John Taylor\nCurator at the Department of Egypt and Sudan at the British Museum</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
