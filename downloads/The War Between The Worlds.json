  "description": "<p>This year's Reith lecturer is Professor Patricia Williams, one of the most well known intellectuals in American law.  </p><p>In her fourth of five Reith lectures Professor Patricia Williams examines the impact of racialised science on attitudes to race. She argues that scientific statements about black people in terms of genetic attributes of, for example, athleticism or intelligence, nurture racial stereotyping; and she explains why it is so difficult to argue against what are supposedly scientific facts.</p>",
