  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay's essays written in 1787/8 in support of the new US Constitution. They published these anonymously in New York as 'Publius' but, when it became known that Hamilton and Madison were the main authors, the essays took on a new significance for all states.  As those two men played a major part in drafting the Constitution itself, their essays have since informed debate over what the authors of that Constitution truly intended.  To some, the essays have proved to be America’s greatest contribution to political thought.</p><p>With</p><p>Frank Cogliano\nProfessor of American History at the University of Edinburgh and Interim Saunders Director of the International Centre for Jefferson Studies at Monticello</p><p>Kathleen Burk\nProfessor Emerita of Modern and Contemporary History at University College London</p><p>And</p><p>Nicholas Guyatt\nProfessor of North American History at the University of Cambridge</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>Reading list: </p><p>Bernard Bailyn, To Begin the World Anew: The Genius and Ambiguities of the American Founders (Knopf, 2003)</p><p>Mary Sarah Bilder, Madison’s Hand: Revising the Constitutional Convention (Harvard University Press, 2015)</p><p>Noah Feldman, The Three Lives of James Madison: Genius, Partisan, President (Random House, 2017)</p><p>Jonathan Gienapp, The Second Creation: Fixing the American Constitution in the Founding Era (Harvard University Press, 2018)</p><p>Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, James Madison (eds.
