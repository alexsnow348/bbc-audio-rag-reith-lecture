  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss one of the influential painters at the heart of the French Impressionist movement: Berthe Morisot (1841-1895).  The men in her circle could freely paint in busy bars and public spaces, while Morisot captured the domestic world and found new, daring ways to paint quickly in the open air.  Her work shows women as they were, to her: informal, unguarded, and not transformed or distorted for the eyes of men.  The image above is one of her few self-portraits, though several portraits of her survive by other artists, chiefly her sister Edma and her brother-in-law Edouard Manet. </p><p>With </p><p>Tamar Garb\nProfessor of History of Art at University College London</p><p>Lois Oliver\nCurator at the Royal Academy and Adjunct Professor of Art History at the American University of Notre Dame London.</p><p>And</p><p>Claire Moran\nReader in French at Queen's University Belfast</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
