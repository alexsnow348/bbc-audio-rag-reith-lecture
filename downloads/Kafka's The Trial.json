  "title": "Kafka's The Trial",
  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Franz Kafka's novel of power and alienation 'The Trial', in which readers follow the protagonist Joseph K into a bizarre, nightmarish world in which he stands accused of an unknown crime; courts of interrogation convene in obscure tenement buildings; and there seems to be no escape from a crushing, oppressive bureaucracy.</p><p>Kafka was a German-speaking Jew who lived in the Czech city of Prague, during the turbulent years which followed the First World War. He spent his days working as a lawyer for an insurance company, but by night he wrote stories and novels considered some of the high points of twentieth century literature. His explorations of power and alienation have chimed with existentialists, Marxists, psychoanalysts, postmodernists - and Radio 4 listeners, who suggested this as our topic for listener week on In Our Time.</p><p>GUESTS</p><p>Elizabeth Boa, Professor Emerita of German at the University of Nottingham\nSteve Connor, Grace 2 Professor of English at the University of Cambridge\nRitchie Robertson, Taylor Professor of the German Language and Literature at the University of Oxford</p><p>Producer: Luke Mulhall.</p>",
