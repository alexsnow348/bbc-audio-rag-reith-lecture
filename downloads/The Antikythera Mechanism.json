  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the 2000-year-old device which transformed our understanding of astronomy in ancient Greece.  In 1900 a group of sponge divers found the wreck of a ship off the coast of the Greek island of Antikythera. Among the items salvaged was a corroded bronze object, the purpose of which was not at first clear. It turned out to be one of the most important discoveries in marine archaeology. Over time, researchers worked out that it was some kind of astronomical analogue computer, the only one to survive from this period as bronze objects were so often melted down for other uses. In recent decades, detailed examination of the Antikythera Mechanism using the latest scientific techniques indicates that it is a particularly intricate tool for showing the positions of planets, the sun and moon, with a complexity and precision not surpassed for over a thousand years.</p><p>With </p><p>Mike Edmunds \nEmeritus Professor of Astrophysics at Cardiff University</p><p>Jo Marchant \nScience journalist and author of 'Decoding the Heavens' on the Antikythera Mechanism</p><p>And </p><p>Liba Taub \nProfessor Emerita in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Cambridge and Visiting Scholar at the Deutsches Museum, Munich</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson\nIn Our Time is a BBC Studios Audio Production</p><p>Reading list:</p><p>Derek de Solla Price, Gears from the Greeks: The Antikythera Mechanism (American Philosophical Society Press, 1974)</p><p>M.
