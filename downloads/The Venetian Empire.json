  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the remarkable rise of Venice in the eastern Mediterranean. Unlike other Italian cities of the early medieval period, Venice had not been settled during the Roman Empire. Rather, it was a refuge for those fleeing unrest after the fall of Rome who settled on these boggy islands on a lagoon and developed into a power that ran an empire from mainland Italy, down the Adriatic coast, across the Peloponnese to Crete and Cyprus, past Constantinople and into the Black Sea.  This was a city without walls, just one of the surprises for visitors who marvelled at the stability and influence of Venice right up to the 17th Century when the Ottomans, Spain, France and the Hapsburgs were to prove too much especially with trade shifting to the Atlantic.</p><p>With </p><p>Maartje van Gelder\nProfessor in Early Modern History at the University of Amsterdam</p><p>Stephen Bowd\nProfessor of Early Modern History at the University of Edinburgh</p><p>And</p><p>Georg Christ\nSenior Lecturer in Medieval and Early Modern History at the University of Manchester</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>Reading list:</p><p>Michel Balard and Christian Buchet (eds.), The Sea in History: The Medieval World (Boydell &amp; Brewer, 2017), especially ‘The Naval Power of Venice in the Eastern Mediterranean’ by Ruthy Gertwagen</p><p>Stephen D.
