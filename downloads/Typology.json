  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests explore typology, a method of biblical interpretation that aims to meaningfully link people, places, and events in the Hebrew Bible, what Christians call the Old Testament, with the coming of Christ in the New Testament.  Old Testament figures like Moses, Jonah, and King David were regarded by Christians as being ‘types’ or symbols of Jesus. </p><p>This way of thinking became hugely popular in medieval Europe, Renaissance England and Victorian Britain, as Christians sought to make sense of their Jewish inheritance - sometimes rejecting that inheritance with antisemitic fervour. It was a way of seeing human history as part of a divine plan, with ancient events prefiguring more modern ones, and it influenced debates about the relationship between metaphor and reality in the bible, in literature, and in art. It also influenced attitudes towards reality, time and history.   </p><p>With</p><p>Miri Rubin, Professor of Medieval and Early Modern History at Queen Mary, University of London</p><p>Harry Spillane, Munby Fellow in Bibliography at Cambridge and Research Fellow at Darwin College</p><p>And </p><p>Sophie Lunn-Rockliffe, Associate Professor in Patristics at Cambridge. </p><p>Producer: Eliane Glaser</p><p>Reading list:</p><p>A.
