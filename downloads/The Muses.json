  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the Muses and their role in Greek mythology, when they were goddesses of poetry, song, music and dance: what the Greeks called mousike, 'the art of the Muses' from which we derive our word 'music.' While the number of Muses, their origin and their roles varied in different accounts and at different times, they were consistently linked with the nature of artistic inspiration. This raised a question for philosophers then and since: was a creative person an empty vessel into which the Muses poured their gifts, at their will, or could that person do something to make inspiration flow? </p><p>With</p><p>Paul Cartledge\nEmeritus Professor of Greek Culture and AG Leventis Senior Research Fellow at Clare College, University of Cambridge</p><p>Angie Hobbs\nProfessor of the Public Understanding of Philosophy, University of Sheffield</p><p>And</p><p>Penelope Murray\nFounder member and retired Senior Lecturer, Department of Classics, University of Warwick</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>Image: 'Apollo and the Muses (Parnassus)', 1631-1632.
