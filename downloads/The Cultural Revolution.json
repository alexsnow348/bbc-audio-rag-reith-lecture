  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Chairman Mao and the revolt he led within his own party from 1966, setting communists against each other, to renew the revolution that he feared had become too bourgeois and to remove his enemies and rivals.

Over a billion copies of Chairman Mao’s Little Red Book were printed to support his cult of personality, before Mao himself died in 1976 and the revolution came to an end.</p><p>The image above is of Red Guards, holding The Little Red Book, cheering Mao during a meeting to celebrate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at Tiananmen Square, Beijing, August 1966 </p><p>With</p><p>Rana Mitter\nProfessor of the History and Politics of Modern China and Fellow of St Cross College, University of Oxford</p><p>Sun Peidong\nVisiting Professor at the Center for International Studies at Sciences Po, Paris</p><p>And</p><p>Julia Lovell\nProfessor in Modern Chinese History and Literature at Birkbeck, University of London</p><p>Produced by Simon Tillotson and Julia Johnson</p>",
