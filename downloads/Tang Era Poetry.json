  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss two of China’s greatest poets, Li Bai and Du Fu, who wrote in the 8th century in the Tang Era. Li Bai (701-762AD) is known for personal poems, many of them about drinking wine, and for finding the enjoyment in life.  Du Fu (712-770AD), a few years younger, is more of an everyman, writing in the upheaval of the An Lushan Rebellion (755-763AD). Together they have been a central part of Chinese culture for over a millennium, reflecting the balance between the individual and the public life, and one sign of their enduring appeal is that there is rarely agreement on which of them is the greater.</p><p>The image above is intended to depict Du Fu.</p><p>With </p><p>Tim Barrett\nProfessor Emeritus of East Asian History at SOAS, University of London</p><p>Tian Yuan Tan\nShaw Professor of Chinese at the University of Oxford and Professorial Fellow at University College</p><p>And</p><p>Frances Wood\nFormer Curator of the Chinese Collections at the British Library</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
