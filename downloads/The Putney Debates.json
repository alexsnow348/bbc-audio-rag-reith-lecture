  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Putney Debates. For several weeks in late 1647, after the defeat of King Charles I in the first hostilities of the Civil War, representatives of the New Model Army and the radical Levellers met in a church in Putney to debate the future of England. There was much to discuss: who should be allowed to vote, civil liberties and religious freedom. The debates were inconclusive, but the ideas aired in Putney had a considerable influence on centuries of political thought.</p><p>With:</p><p>Justin Champion\nProfessor of the History of Early Modern Ideas at Royal Holloway, University of London</p><p>Ann Hughes \nProfessor of Early Modern History at Keele University</p><p>Kate Peters \nFellow in History at Murray Edwards College, Cambridge.</p><p>Producer: Thomas Morris.</p>",
