  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the life, works, context and legacy of Antarah (525-608AD), the great poet and warrior.  According to legend, he was born a slave; his mother was an Ethiopian slave, his father an elite Arab cavalryman.  Antarah won his freedom in battle and loved a woman called Abla who refused him, and they were later celebrated in the saga of Antar and Abla. One of Antarah's poems was so esteemed in pre-Islamic Arabia that it is believed it was hung up on the wall of the Kaaba in Mecca. </p><p>With </p><p>James Montgomery\nSir Thomas Adams's Professor of Arabic at the University of Cambridge</p><p>Marlé Hammond\nSenior Lecturer in Arabic Popular Literature and Culture at SOAS, University of London</p><p>And </p><p>Harry Munt\nLecturer in Medieval History at the University of York</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
