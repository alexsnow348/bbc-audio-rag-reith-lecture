  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) and his role in the development of electrical systems towards the end of the nineteenth century.  He made his name in New York in the contest over which current should flow into homes and factories in America.  Some such as Edison backed direct current or DC while others such as Westinghouse backed alternating current or AC and Nikola Tesla’s invention of a motor that worked on AC swung it for the alternating system that went on to power the modern age.  He ensured his reputation and ideas burnt brightly for the next decades, making him synonymous with the lone, genius inventor of the new science fiction.  </p><p>With </p><p>Simon Schaffer\nEmeritus Fellow of Darwin College, University of Cambridge</p><p>Jill Jonnes\nHistorian and author of “Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse and the Race to Electrify the World”</p><p>And </p><p>Iwan Morus\nProfessor of History at Aberystwyth University</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>Reading list: </p><p>W.
