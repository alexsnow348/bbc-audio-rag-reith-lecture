  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the Dutch artist famous for starry nights and sunflowers, self portraits and simple chairs. These are images known the world over, and Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) painted them and around 900 others in the last decade of his short, brilliant life and, famously, in that lifetime he made only one recorded sale.  Yet within a few decades after his death these extraordinary works, with all their colour and life, became the most desirable of all modern art, propelled in part by the story of Vincent van Gogh's struggle with mental health.</p><p>With </p><p>Christopher Riopelle\nThe Neil Westreich Curator of Post 1800 Paintings at the National Gallery</p><p>Martin Bailey\nA leading Van Gogh specialist and correspondent for The Art Newspaper</p><p>And </p><p>Frances Fowle\nProfessor of Nineteenth Century Art at the University of Edinburgh and Senior Curator at National Galleries Scotland</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>Reading list: </p><p>Martin Bailey, Living with Vincent Van Gogh: The Homes and Landscapes that shared the Artist (White Lion Publishing, 2019)</p><p>Martin Bailey, Studio of the South: Van Gogh in Provence (Frances Lincoln, 2021)</p><p>Martin Bailey, Van Gogh’s Finale: Auvers and the Artist’s Rise to Fame (Frances Lincoln, 2021)</p><p>Nienke Bakker and Ella Hendriks, Van Gogh and the Sunflowers: A Masterpiece Examined (Van Gogh Museum, 2019)</p><p>Nienke Bakker, Emmanuel Coquery, Teio Meedendorp and Louis van Tilborgh (eds), Van Gogh in Auvers-sur-Oise: His Final Months (Thames &amp; Hudson, 2023)</p><p>Frances Fowle, Van Gogh's Twin: The Scottish Art Dealer Alexander Reid, 1854-1928 (National Galleries of Scotland, 2010) </p><p>Bregje Gerritse, The Potato Eaters: Van Gogh’s First Masterpiece (Van Gogh Museum, 2021)</p><p>Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, Van Gogh: The Life (Random House, 2012)</p><p>Leo Jansen, Hans Luijten and Nienke Bakker (eds), Vincent van Gogh: The Letters: The Complete Illustrated and Annotated Edition (Thames and Hudson Ltd, 2009)</p><p>Leo Jansen, Hans Luijten and Nienke Bakker (eds), Vincent van Gogh, A Life in Letters (Thames and Hudson Ltd, 2020)</p><p>Hans Luitjen, Jo van Gogh Bonger: The Woman who Made Vincent Famous Bloomsbury, 2022</p><p>Louis van Tilborgh, Martin Bailey, Karen Serres (ed.), Van Gogh Self-Portraits (Courtauld Institute, 2022)</p><p>Ingo F.
