  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss enzymes, the proteins that control the speed of chemical reactions in living organisms. Without enzymes, these reactions would take place too slowly to keep organisms alive: with their actions as catalysts, changes which might otherwise take millions of years can happen hundreds of times a second. Some enzymes break down large molecules into smaller ones, like the ones in human intestines, while others use small molecules to build up larger, complex ones, such as those that make DNA. Enzymes also help keep cell growth under control, by regulating the time for cells to live and their time to die, and provide a way for cells to communicate with each other. </p><p>With </p><p>Nigel Richards\nProfessor of Biological Chemistry at Cardiff University</p><p>Sarah Barry\nLecturer in Chemical Biology at King's College London</p><p>And </p><p>Jim Naismith\nDirector of the Research Complex at Harwell\nBishop Wardlaw Professor of Chemical Biology at the University of St Andrews\nProfessor of Structural Biology at the University of Oxford</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>",
