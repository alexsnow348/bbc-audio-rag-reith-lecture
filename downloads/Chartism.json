There they witnessed the launch of the People’s Charter, a list of demands for political reform. The changes they called for included voting by secret ballot, equal-sized constituencies and, most importantly, that all men should have the vote. </p><p>The Chartists, as they came to be known, were the first national mass working-class movement. In the decade that followed, they collected six million signatures for their Petitions to Parliament: all were rejected, but their campaign had a significant and lasting impact. </p><p>With </p><p>Joan Allen\nVisiting Fellow in History at Newcastle University and Chair of the Society for the Study of Labour History</p><p>Emma Griffin \nProfessor of Modern British History at the University of East Anglia and President of the Royal Historical Society </p><p>and </p><p>Robert Saunders \nReader in Modern British History at Queen Mary, University of London.</p><p>The image above shows a Chartist mass meeting on Kennington Common in London in April 1848.</p>",
