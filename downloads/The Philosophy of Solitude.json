  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the philosophy of solitude. The state of being alone can arise for many different reasons: imprisonment, exile or personal choice. It can be prompted by religious belief, personal necessity or a philosophical need for solitary contemplation. Many thinkers have dealt with the subject, from Plato and Aristotle to Hannah Arendt. It's a philosophical tradition that takes in medieval religious mystics, the work of Montaigne and Adam Smith, and the great American poets of solitude Thoreau and Emerson.</p><p>With:</p><p>Melissa Lane\nProfessor of Politics at Princeton University</p><p>Simon Blackburn\nProfessor of Philosophy at the New College of the Humanities and Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge</p><p>John Haldane\nProfessor of Philosophy at the University of St Andrews</p><p>Producer: Thomas Morris.</p>",
