  "description": "<p>English composer Alexander Goehr gives his sixth Reith Lecture from the series entitled 'The Survival of the Symphony'. </p><p>In this lecture entitled 'Stand Up and Be Misunderstood', he concludes his series by stressing why musicians and the public alike should fight to renew the symphony. Extolling it as the greatest and yet most often rejected musical institution. Professor Goehr warns that the 'neglect of established cultural institutions can only further contribute to the neglect of city centres'. Will anyone hear his warning and save the symphony?\n</p>",
