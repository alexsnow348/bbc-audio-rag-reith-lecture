  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the form of Christianity adopted by Ostrogoths in the 4th century AD, which they learned from Roman missionaries and from their own contact with the imperial court at Constantinople. This form spread to the Vandals and the Visigoths, who took it into Roman Spain and North Africa, and the Ostrogoths brought it deeper into Italy after the fall of the western Roman empire. Meanwhile, with the Roman empire in the east now firmly committed to the Nicene Creed not the Arian, the Goths and Vandals faced conflict or conversion, as Arianism moved from an orthodox view to being a heresy that would keep followers from heaven and delay the Second Coming for all.</p><p>The image above is the ceiling mosaic of the Arian Baptistry in Ravenna, commissioned by Theodoric, ruler of the Ostrogothic Kingdom of Italy, around the end of the 5th century</p><p>With</p><p>Judith Herrin\nProfessor of Late Antique and Byzantine Studies, Emeritus, at King's College London</p><p>Robin Whelan\nLecturer in Mediterranean History at the University of Liverpool</p><p>And</p><p>Martin Palmer\nVisiting Professor in Religion, History and Nature at the University of Winchester</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
