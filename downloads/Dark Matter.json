  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss dark matter, the mysterious and invisible substance which is believed to make up most of the Universe. In 1932 the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort noticed that the speed at which galaxies moved was at odds with the amount of material they appeared to contain. He hypothesized that much of this 'missing' matter was simply invisible to telescopes. Today astronomers and particle physicists are still fascinated by the search for dark matter and the question of what it is.</p><p>With </p><p>Carolin Crawford\nPublic Astronomer at the Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge and Gresham Professor of Astronomy</p><p>Carlos Frenk\nOgden Professor of Fundamental Physics and Director of the Institute for Computational Cosmology at the University of Durham</p><p>Anne Green\nReader in Physics at the University of Nottingham</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>",
