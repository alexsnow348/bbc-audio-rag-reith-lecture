Shakespeare defined this individual in language which accepted the primacy of the male gender: “What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason!  How infinite in faculty!  In form, in moving, how express and admirable! In action how like an angel! In apprehension how like a God!” According to Michel Foucault, French philosopher, polar opposite of Shakespeare and backed as he thought by Marx and Freud, our century killed the individual off.
