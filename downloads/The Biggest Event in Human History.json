  "description": "<p>Stuart Russell explores the future of Artificial Intelligence and asks; how can we get our relationship with it right? Professor Russell is founder of the Centre for Human-Compatible Artificial Intelligence at the University of California, Berkeley. In this lecture he reflects on the birth of AI, tracing our thinking about it back to Aristotle. He outlines the definition of AI, its successes and failures, and the risks it poses for the future. Referencing the representation of AI systems in film and popular culture, Professor Russell will examine whether our fears are well founded. He will explain what led him – alongside previous Reith Lecturer Professor Stephen Hawking to say that “success would be the biggest event in human history … and perhaps the last event in human history.” Stuart will ask how this risk arises and whether it can be avoided, allowing humanity and AI to coexist successfully.</p><p>This lecture and question-and-answer session was recorded at the Alan Turing Institute at the British Library in London.\nPresenter: Anita Anand\nProducer: Jim Frank\nEditor: Hugh Levinson\nProduction Coordinator: Brenda Brown\nSound: Neil Churchill and Hal Haines</p>",
