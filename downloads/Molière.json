  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss one of the great figures in world literature. The French playwright Molière (1622-1673) began as an actor, aiming to be a tragedian, but he was stronger in comedy, touring with a troupe for 13 years until Louis XIV summoned him to audition at the Louvre and gave him his break.  It was in Paris and at Versailles that Molière wrote and performed his best known plays, among them Tartuffe, Le Misanthrope and Le Malade Imaginaire, and in time he was so celebrated that French became known as The Language of Molière.</p><p>With </p><p>Noel Peacock\nEmeritus Marshall Professor in French Language and Literature at the University of Glasgow</p><p>Jan Clarke\nProfessor of French at Durham University</p><p>And </p><p>Joe Harris\nProfessor of Early Modern French and Comparative Literature at Royal Holloway, University of London</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>Reading list:</p><p>David Bradby and Andrew Calder (eds.), The Cambridge Companion to Molière (Cambridge University Press, 2006)</p><p>Jan Clarke (ed.), Molière in Context (Cambridge University Press, 2022)</p><p>Georges Forestier, Molière (Gallimard, 2018)</p><p>Michael Hawcroft, Molière: Reasoning with Fools (Oxford University Press, 2007)</p><p>John D.
