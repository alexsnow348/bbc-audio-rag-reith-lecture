  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the life of the Welsh nobleman, also known as Owen Glendower, who began a revolt against Henry IV in 1400 which was at first very successful.  Glyndwr (c1359-c1415) adopted the title Prince of Wales and established a parliament and his own foreign policy, until he was defeated by the future Henry V.  Owain Glyndwr escaped and led guerilla attacks for several years but was never betrayed to the English, disappearing without trace.</p><p>With </p><p>Huw Pryce\nProfessor of Welsh History at Bangor University</p><p>Helen Fulton\nProfessor of Medieval Literature at the University of Bristol</p><p>Chris Given-Wilson\nEmeritus Professor of Medieval History at the University of St Andrews</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
