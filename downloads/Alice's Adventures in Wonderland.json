  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Lewis Carroll's book which first appeared in print in 1865 with illustrations by John Tenniel. It has since become one of the best known works in English, captivating readers who follow young Alice as she chases a white rabbit, pink eyed, in a waistcoat with pocket watch, down a rabbit hole that becomes a well and into wonderland. There she meets the Cheshire Cat, the Hatter, the March Hare, the Mock Turtle and more, all the while growing smaller and larger, finally outgrowing everyone at the trial of Who Stole the Tarts from the Queen of Hearts and exclaiming 'Who cares for you? You’re nothing but a pack of cards!'</p><p>With</p><p>Franziska Kohlt\nLeverhulme Research Fellow in the History of Science at the University of Leeds and the Inaugural Carrollian Fellow of the University of Southern California</p><p>Kiera Vaclavik\nProfessor of Children’s Literature and Childhood Culture at Queen Mary, University of London</p><p>And</p><p>Robert Douglas-Fairhurst\nProfessor of English Literature at Magdalen College, University of Oxford</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>Reading list:</p><p>Kate Bailey and Simon Sladen (eds), Alice: Curiouser and Curiouser (V&amp;A Publishing, 2021)</p><p>Gillian Beer, Alice in Space: The Sideways Victorian World of Lewis Carroll (University of Chicago Press, 2016)</p><p>Will Brooker, Alice's Adventures: Lewis Carroll and Alice in Popular Culture (Continuum, 2004)</p><p>Humphrey Carpenter, Secret Gardens: A Study of the Golden Age of Children’s Literature (first published 1985; Faber and Faber, 2009)</p><p>Lewis Carroll (introduced by Martin Gardner), The Annotated Alice: The Definitive Edition, (W.
