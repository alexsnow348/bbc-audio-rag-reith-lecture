  "description": "<p>This year's Reith lecturer is Professor Patricia Williams, one of the most well known intellectuals in American law.  </p><p>In her third Reith lecture, Professor Patricia Williams looks at the juxtaposition of race and class and their interaction in society and argues that there is a tendency of the dominant society to conflate race and class, especially when constructing black stereotypes.
