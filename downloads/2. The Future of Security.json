  "description": "<p>This year's BBC Reith Lecturer is Ben Ansell, Professor of Comparative Democratic Institutions at Nuffield College, Oxford University.  He will deliver four lectures called “Our Democratic Future.”</p><p>In his series Professor Ansell asks how we can build a politics that works for all of us with systems which are robust to the challenges of the twenty first century, from climate change to artificial intelligence.  The lectures build on his recent book Why Politics Fails, which identifies a series of traps that prevent us from attaining our collective goals and presents solutions to help us overcome those traps. </p><p>In this second lecture called 'The Future of Security', recorded in Berlin in front of an audience,  he asks whether citizens of wealthy countries have been lulled into a false sense of security about threats from abroad and at home. It examines how we can control the security technologies of tomorrow, from facial recognition to autonomous weapons. And Ansell suggests how we can develop technologies powerful enough to protect us without exploiting us.\n \nThe Reith Lectures are chaired by Anita Anand and produced by Jim Frank. \nThe Editor is China Collins, and the coordinator is Brenda Brown.  \nThe series is mixed by Rod Farquhar and Neil Churchill.</p>",
