  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss one of the canonical figures from the history of political thought. Marsilius of Padua (c1275 to c1343) wrote 'Defensor Pacis' (The Defender of the Peace) around 1324 when the Papacy, the Holy Roman Emperor and the French King were fighting over who had supreme power on Earth. In this work Marsilius argued that the people were the source of all power and they alone could elect a leader to act on their behalf; they could remove their leaders when they chose and, afterwards, could hold them to account for their actions. He appeared to favour an elected Holy Roman Emperor and he was clear that there were no grounds for the Papacy to have secular power, let alone gather taxes and wealth, and that clerics should return to the poverty of the Apostles.  Protestants naturally found his work attractive in the 16th Century when breaking with Rome.  In the 20th Century Marsilius has been seen as an early advocate for popular sovereignty and republican democracy, to the extent possible in his time.</p><p>With </p><p>Annabel Brett\nProfessor of Political Thought and History at the University of Cambridge</p><p>George Garnett\nProfessor of Medieval History and Fellow and Tutor at St Hugh’s College, University of Oxford</p><p>And </p><p>Serena Ferente\nProfessor of Medieval History at the University of Amsterdam</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson\nIn Our Time is a BBC Sounds Audio Production</p><p>Reading list:  </p><p>Richard Bourke and Quentin Skinner (eds), Popular Sovereignty in Historical Perspective (Cambridge University Press, 2016), especially 'Popolo and law in Marsilius and the jurists' by Serena Ferente</p><p>J.
