  "description": "<p>The philosopher and cultural theorist Kwame Anthony Appiah argues for a world free of racial fixations. </p><p>He tells the story of Anton Wilhelm Amo Afer. He was five years old when he was brought from the Gold Coast to Germany in 1707, educated at a royal court and became an eminent philosopher. He argues that this elaborate Enlightenment experiment illuminates a series of mistaken ideas , including that there is a \"racial essence\" which all members of that race carry. Modern science long ago disproved this, as almost all of the world's genetic variation is found within every so-called racial group. Instead, \"race is something we make; not something that makes us.\"</p><p>The lecture is recorded in front of an audience at the British Council in Accra, Ghana. The series is presented and chaired by Sue Lawley</p><p>The producer is Jim Frank.</p>",
