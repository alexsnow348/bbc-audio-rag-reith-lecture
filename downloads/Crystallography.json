  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the history of crystallography, the study of crystals and their structure. The discovery in the early 20th century that X-rays could be diffracted by a crystal revolutionised our knowledge of materials. This crystal technology has touched most people's lives, thanks to the vital role it plays in diverse scientific disciplines - from physics and chemistry, to molecular biology and mineralogy. To date, 28 Nobel Prizes have been awarded to scientists working with X-ray crystallography, an indication of its crucial importance. </p><p>The history of crystallography began with the work of Johannes Kepler in the 17th century, but perhaps the most crucial leap in understanding came with the work of the father-and-son team the Braggs in 1912. They built on the work of the German physicist Max von Laue who had proved that X-rays are a form of light waves and that it was possible to scatter these rays using a crystal. The Braggs undertook seminal experiments which transformed our perception of crystals and their atomic arrangements, and led to some of the most significant scientific findings of the last century - such as revealing the structure of DNA. </p><p>With:</p><p>Judith Howard\nDirector of the Biophysical Sciences Institute and Professor of Chemistry at the University of Durham</p><p>Chris Hammond\nLife Fellow in Material Science at the University of Leeds</p><p>Mike Glazer\nEmeritus Professor of Physics at the University of Oxford and Visiting Professor of Physics at the University of Warwick</p><p>Producer: Natalia Fernandez.</p>",
