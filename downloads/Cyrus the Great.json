  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests explore the history and reputation of the Persian ruler Cyrus the Great. Cyrus the Second of Persia as he was known then was born in the sixth century BCE in Persis which is now in Iran. He was the founder of the first Persian Empire, the largest empire at that point in history, spanning more than two million square miles.  </p><p>His story was told by the Greek historians Herodotus and Xenophon, and in the Hebrew bible he is praised for freeing the Jewish captives in Babylon. </p><p>But the historical facts are intertwined with fiction.</p><p>Cyrus proclaimed himself ‘king of the four corners of the world’ in the famous Cyrus Cylinder, one of the most admired objects in the British Museum. It’s been called by some the first bill of human rights, but that’s a label which has been disputed by most scholars today.</p><p>With</p><p>Mateen Arghandehpour, a researcher for the Invisible East Project at Oxford University,</p><p>Lindsay Allen, Senior Lecturer in Ancient Greek and Near Eastern History at King’s College London,</p><p>And</p><p>Lynette Mitchell, Professor Emerita in Classics and Ancient History at Exeter University.</p><p>Producer: Eliane Glaser</p><p>Reading list:</p><p>Pierre Briant (trans.
