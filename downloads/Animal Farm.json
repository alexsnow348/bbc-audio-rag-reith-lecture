  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Animal Farm, which Eric Blair published under his pen name George Orwell in 1945. </p><p>A biting critique of totalitarianism, particularly Stalinism, the essay sprung from Orwell's experiences fighting Fascists in Spain: he thought that all on the left were on the same side, until the dominant Communists violently suppressed the Anarchists and Trotskyists, and Orwell had to escape to France to avoid arrest. </p><p>Setting his satire in an English farm, Orwell drew on the Russian Revolution of 1917, on Stalin's cult of personality and the purges. The leaders on Animal Farm are pigs, the secret police are attack dogs, the supporters who drown out debate with \"four legs good, two legs bad\" are sheep.</p><p>At first, London publishers did not want to touch Orwell's work out of sympathy for the USSR, an ally of Britain in the Second World War, but the Cold War gave it a new audience and Animal Farm became a commercial as well as a critical success.</p><p>Featuring:   </p><p>Steven Connor - Grace 2 Professor of English at the University of Cambridge</p><p>Mary Vincent - Professor of Modern European History at the University of Sheffield</p><p>Robert Colls - Professor of Cultural History at De Montfort University</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>First broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in September 2016.</p>",
