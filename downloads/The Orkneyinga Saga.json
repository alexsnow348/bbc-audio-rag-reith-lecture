  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the Saga of the Earls of Orkney, as told in the 13th Century by an unknown Icelander. This was the story of arguably the most important, strategically, of all the islands in the British Viking world, when the Earls controlled Shetland, Orkney and Caithness from which they could raid the Irish and British coasts, from Dublin round to Lindisfarne. The Saga combines myth with history, bringing to life the places on those islands where Vikings met, drank, made treaties, told stories, became saints, plotted and fought.</p><p>With </p><p>Judith Jesch\nProfessor of Viking Studies at the University of Nottingham</p><p>Jane Harrison\nArchaeologist and Research Associate at Oxford and Newcastle Universities</p><p>And </p><p>Alex Woolf\nSenior Lecturer in History at the University of St Andrews</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>In Our Time is a BBC Studios Audio Production</p><p>Reading list:</p><p>Theodore M.
