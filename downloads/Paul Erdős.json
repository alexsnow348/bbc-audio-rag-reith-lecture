  "description": "<p>Paul Erdős (1913 – 1996) is one of the most celebrated mathematicians of the 20th century. During his long career, he made a number of impressive advances in our understanding of maths and developed whole new fields in the subject. </p><p>He was born into a Jewish family in Hungary just before the outbreak of World War I, and his life was shaped by the rise of fascism in Europe, anti-Semitism and the Cold War. His reputation for mathematical problem solving is unrivalled and he was extraordinarily prolific.  He produced more than 1,500 papers and collaborated with around 500 other academics.  </p><p>He also had an unconventional lifestyle. Instead of having a long-term post at one university, he spent much of his life travelling around visiting other mathematicians, often staying for just a few days. </p><p>With </p><p>Colva Roney-Dougal \nProfessor of Pure Mathematics at the University of St Andrews</p><p>Timothy Gowers\nProfessor of Mathematics at the College de France in Paris and Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge</p><p>and</p><p>Andrew Treglown\nAssociate Professor in Mathematics at the University of Birmingham</p><p>The image above shows a graph occurring in Ramsey Theory.
