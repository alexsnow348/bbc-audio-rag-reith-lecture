  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Medici family, who dominated Florence's political and cultural life for three centuries. The House of Medici came to prominence in Italy in the fifteenth century as a result of the wealth they had built up through banking. With the rise of Cosimo de' Medici, they became Florence's most powerful and influential dynasty, effectively controlling the city's government. Their patronage of the arts turned Florence into a leading centre of the Renaissance and the Medici Bank was one of the most successful institutions of its day. As well as producing four popes, members of the House of Medici married into various European royal families.</p><p>With:</p><p>Evelyn Welch\nProfessor of Renaissance Studies at King's College, University of London</p><p>Robert Black\nProfessor of Renaissance History at the University of Leeds</p><p>Catherine Fletcher\nLecturer in Public History at the University of Sheffield</p><p>Producer: Victoria Brignell.</p>",
