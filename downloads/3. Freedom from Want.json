  "description": "<p>Author and musician Darren McGarvey gives the third of four BBC Reith Lectures on the theme of liberty, addressing \"Freedom from Want.\" McGarvey argues that the present system isn't working for many but that it is incumbent on citizens to confront that and rise to the challenge of what inequality means. Individuals, he says, need to take personal responsibility and reject the apathy which many working-class communities experience.</p><p>The lecture and question-and-answer session is recorded in Glasgow in front of an audience. The presenter is Anita Anand.</p><p>The year's series was inspired by President Franklin D Roosevelt's four freedoms speech of 1941 and asks what this terrain means now.
