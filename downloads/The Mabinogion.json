  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the eleven stories of Celtic mythology and Arthurian romance known as The Mabinogion, most of which were told and retold for generations before being written down in C14th. Among them are stories of Pwyll and Rhiannon and their son Pryderi, of Culhwch and Olwen, of the dream of the Emperor Macsen, of Lludd and Llefelys, of magic and giants and imagined history. With common themes but no single author, they project an image of the Island of Britain before the Anglo-Saxons and Normans and before Edward I's conquest of Wales. They came to new prominence, worldwide, from C19th with the translation into English by Lady Charlotte Guest aided by William Owen Pughe.</p><p>The image above is of Cynon ap Clydno approaching the Castle of Maidens from the tale of Owain, or the Lady of the Fountain</p><p>With </p><p>Sioned Davies\nProfessor in the School of Welsh at Cardiff University</p><p>Helen Fulton\nProfessor of Medieval Literature at the University of Bristol</p><p>And</p><p>Juliette Wood\nAssociate Lecturer in the School of Welsh at Cardiff University</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>",
