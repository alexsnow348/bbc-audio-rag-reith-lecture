  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the celebrated Welsh poet, Dylan Thomas (1914 - 1953). He wrote some of his best poems before he was twenty in the first half of his short, remarkable life, and was prolific in the second half too with poems such as those set in London under the Blitz and reworkings of his childhood in Swansea, and his famous radio play Under Milk Wood (performed after his death). He was read widely and widely heard: with his reading tours in America and recordings of his works that sold in their hundreds of thousands after his death, he is credited with reviving the act of poetry as performance in the 20th century.</p><p>With</p><p>Nerys Williams\nAssociate Professor of Poetry and Poetics at University College Dublin</p><p>John Goodby\nProfessor of Arts and Culture at Sheffield Hallam University</p><p>And</p><p>Leo Mellor\nThe Roma Gill Fellow in English at Murray Edwards College, University of Cambridge</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
