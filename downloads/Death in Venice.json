  "description": "<p>Death in Venice is Thomas Mann’s most famous – and infamous - novella.\nPublished in 1912, it’s about the fall of the repressed writer Gustav von Aschenbach, when his supposedly objective appreciation of a young boy’s beauty becomes sexual obsession.\nIt explores the link between creativity and self-destruction, and by the end Aschenbach’s humiliation is complete, dying on a deckchair in the act of ogling. Aschenbach's stalking of the boy and dreaming of pederasty can appal modern readers,  even more than Mann expected. </p><p>With </p><p>Karolina Watroba, Post-Doctoral Research Fellow in Modern Languages at All Souls College, University of Oxford</p><p>Erica Wickerson, a Former Research Fellow at St Johns College, University of Cambridge</p><p>Sean Williams, Senior Lecturer in German and European Cultural History at the University of Sheffield </p><p>Sean Williams' series of Radio 3's The Essay, Death in Trieste, can be found here: https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001lzd4</p>",
