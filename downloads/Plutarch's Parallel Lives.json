  "title": "Plutarch's Parallel Lives",
  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the Greek biographer Plutarch (c46 AD-c120 AD) and especially his work 'Parallel Lives' which has shaped the way successive generations see the Classical world. Plutarch was clear that he was writing lives, not histories, and he wrote these very focussed accounts in pairs to contrast and compare the characters of famous Greeks and Romans, side by side, along with their virtues and vices.  This focus on the inner lives of great men was to fascinate Shakespeare, who drew on Plutarch considerably when writing his Julius Caesar, Coriolanus, Timon of Athens and Antony and Cleopatra. While few followed his approach of setting lives in pairs, Plutarch's work was to influence countless biographers especially from the Enlightenment onwards.</p><p>With</p><p>Judith Mossman\nProfessor Emerita of Classics at Coventry University</p><p>Andrew Erskine\nProfessor of Ancient History at the University of Edinburgh</p><p>And </p><p>Paul Cartledge\nAG Leventis Senior Research Fellow of Clare College, University of Cambridge</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>Reading list:</p><p>Mark Beck (ed.), A Companion to Plutarch (Wiley-Blackwell, 2014)</p><p>Colin Burrow, Shakespeare and Classical Antiquity (Oxford University Press, 2013), especially chapter 6</p><p>Raphaëla Dubreuil, Theater and Politics in Plutarch’s Parallel Lives (Brill, 2023)</p><p>Tim Duff, Plutarch’s Lives: Exploring Virtue and Vice (Oxford University Press, 1999)</p><p>Noreen Humble (ed.), Plutarch’s Lives: Parallelism and Purpose (Classical Press of Wales, 2010)</p><p>Robert Lamberton, Plutarch (Yale University Press, 2002)</p><p>Hugh Liebert, Plutarch's Politics: Between City and Empire (Cambridge University Press, 2016)</p><p>Christopher Pelling, Plutarch and History (Classical Press of Wales, 2002)</p><p>Plutarch (trans.
