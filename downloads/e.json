  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss Euler's number, also known as e. First discovered in the seventeenth century by the Swiss mathematician Jacob Bernoulli when he was studying compound interest, e is now recognised as one of the most important and interesting numbers in mathematics. Roughly equal to 2.718, e is useful in studying many everyday situations, from personal savings to epidemics. It also features in Euler's Identity, sometimes described as the most beautiful equation ever written. </p><p>With:</p><p>Colva Roney-Dougal\nReader in Pure Mathematics at the University of St Andrews</p><p>June Barrow-Green\nSenior Lecturer in the History of Maths at the Open University</p><p>Vicky Neale\nWhitehead Lecturer at the Mathematical Institute and Balliol College at the University of Oxford</p><p>Producer: Thomas Morris.</p>",
