  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Orson Welles' film, released in 1941, which is widely acclaimed as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, films yet made.  Welles plays the lead role of Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper magnate, and Welles directed, produced and co-wrote this story of loneliness at the heart of a megalomaniac. The plot was partly inspired by the life of William Randolph Hearst, who then used the power of his own newspapers to try to suppress the film’s release.  It was to take some years before Citizen Kane reached a fuller audience and, from that point, become so celebrated.</p><p>The image above is of Kane addressing a public meeting while running for Governor.</p><p>With </p><p>Stella Bruzzi\nProfessor of Film and Dean of Arts and Humanities at University College London</p><p>Ian Christie\nProfessor of Film and Media History at Birkbeck, University of London</p><p>And </p><p>John David Rhodes\nProfessor of Film Studies and Visual Culture at the University of Cambridge</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
