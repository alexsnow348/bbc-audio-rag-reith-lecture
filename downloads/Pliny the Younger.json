  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the life and work of Pliny the Younger, famous for his letters. A prominent lawyer in Rome in the first century AD, Pliny later became governor of the province of Bithynia, on the Black Sea coast of modern Turkey. Throughout his career he was a prolific letter-writer, sharing his thoughts with great contemporaries including the historian Tacitus, and asking the advice of the Emperor Trajan. Pliny's letters offer fascinating insights into life in ancient Rome and its empire, from the mundane details of irrigation schemes to his vivid eyewitness account of the eruption of Vesuvius.</p><p>With:</p><p>Catharine Edwards\nProfessor of Classics and Ancient History at Birkbeck, University of London</p><p>Roy Gibson\nProfessor of Latin at the University of Manchester</p><p>Alice König \nLecturer in Latin and Classical Studies at the University of St Andrews</p><p>Producer: Thomas Morris.</p>",
