  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Essays of Michel de Montaigne. Born near Bordeaux in 1533, Montaigne retired from a life of public service aged 38 and began to write. He called these short works 'essais', or 'attempts'; they deal with an eclectic range of subjects, from the dauntingly weighty to the apparently trivial. Although he never considered himself a philosopher, he is often now seen as one of the most outstanding Sceptical thinkers of early modern Europe. His approachable style, intelligence and subtle thought have made him one of the most widely admired writers of the Renaissance.</p><p>With:</p><p>David Wootton\nAnniversary Professor of History at York University</p><p>Terence Cave\nEmeritus Professor of French Literature at the University of Oxford</p><p>Felicity Green\nChancellor's Fellow in History at the University of Edinburgh.</p><p>Producer: Thomas Morris.</p>",
