  "title": "Seneca the Younger",
  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Seneca the Younger, who was one of the first great writers to live his entire life in the world of the new Roman empire, after the fall of the Republic. He was a Stoic philosopher, he wrote blood-soaked tragedies, he was an orator, and he navigated his way through the reigns of Caligula, Claudius and Nero, sometimes exercising power at the highest level and at others spending years in exile. Agrippina the Younger was the one who called for him to tutor Nero, and it is thought Seneca helped curb some of Nero's excesses. He was later revered within the Christian church, partly for what he did and partly for what he was said to have done in forged letters to St Paul. His tragedies, with their ghosts and high body count, influenced Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus and Hamlet, and Kyd's Spanish Tragedy. The image above is the so-called bust of Seneca, a detail from Four Philosophers by Peter Paul Rubens.</p><p>With</p><p>Mary Beard\nProfessor of Classics at the University of Cambridge</p><p>Catharine Edwards\nProfessor of Classics and Ancient History at Birkbeck, University of London</p><p>and</p><p>Alessandro Schiesaro\nProfessor of Classics at the University of Manchester</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>",
