  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss Romulus and Remus, the central figures of the foundation myth of Rome.  According to tradition, the twins were abandoned by their parents as babies, but were saved by a she-wolf who found and nursed them.   Romulus killed his brother after a vicious quarrel, and went on to found a city, which was named after him.</p><p>The myth has been at the core of Roman identity since the 1st century AD, although the details vary in different versions of the story.  For many Roman writers, the story embodied the ethos and institutions of their civilisation.   The image of the she-wolf suckling the divinely fathered twins remains a potent icon of the city even today.</p><p>With:</p><p>Mary Beard\nProfessor of Classics at the University of Cambridge\n \nPeter Wiseman\nEmeritus Professor of Classics and Ancient History at the University of Exeter\n \nTim Cornell\nEmeritus Professor of Ancient History at the University of Manchester.</p><p>Producer: Thomas Morris.</p>",
