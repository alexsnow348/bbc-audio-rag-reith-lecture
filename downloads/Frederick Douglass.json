  "description": "<p>In a programme first broadcast in 2018, Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the life and ideas of Frederick Douglass, who was born into slavery in Maryland in 1818 and, once he had escaped, became one of that century's most prominent abolitionists. He was such a good orator, his opponents doubted his story, but he told it in grim detail in 1845 in his book 'Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave.' He went on to address huge audiences in Great Britain and Ireland and there some of his supporters paid off his owner, so Douglass could be free in law and not fear recapture. After the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, he campaigned for equal rights for African-Americans, arguing against those such as Lincoln who had wanted freed slaves to leave America and found a colony elsewhere. \"We were born here,\" he said, \"and here we will remain.\"</p><p>With</p><p>Celeste-Marie Bernier\nProfessor of Black Studies in the English Department at the University of Edinburgh</p><p>Karen Salt\nAssistant Professor in Transnational American Studies at the University of Nottingham</p><p>And</p><p>Nicholas Guyatt\nReader in North American History at the University of Cambridge</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>",
