  "description": "<p>The story of Jane Eyre is one of the best-known in English fiction. Jane is the orphan who survives a miserable early life, first with her aunt at Gateshead Hall and then at Lowood School. She leaves the school for Thornfield Hall, to become governess to the French ward of Mr Rochester. She and Rochester fall in love but, at their wedding, it is revealed he is married already and his wife, insane, is kept in Thornfield's attic. When Jane Eyre was published in 1847, it was a great success and brought fame to Charlotte Bronte. Combined with Gothic mystery and horror, the book explores many themes, including the treatment of children, relations between men and women, religious faith and hypocrisy, individuality, morality, equality and the nature of true love. </p><p>With</p><p>Dinah Birch\nProfessor of English Literature and Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Research at the University of Liverpool</p><p>Karen O'Brien\nVice Principal and Professor of English Literature at King's College London</p><p>And</p><p>Sara Lyons\nLecturer in Victorian Literature at the University of Kent</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>",
