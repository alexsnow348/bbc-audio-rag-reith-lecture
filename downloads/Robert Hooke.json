  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the life and work of Robert Hooke (1635-1703) who worked for Robert Boyle and was curator of experiments at the Royal Society. The engraving of a flea, above, is taken from his Micrographia which caused a sensation when published in 1665. Sometimes remembered for his disputes with Newton, he studied the planets with telescopes and snowflakes with microscopes. He was an early proposer of a theory of evolution, discovered light diffraction with a wave theory to explain it and felt he was rarely given due credit for his discoveries. </p><p>With</p><p>David Wootton\nAnniversary Professor of History at the University of York</p><p>Patricia Fara\nPresident Elect of the British Society for the History of Science</p><p>And</p><p>Rob Iliffe\nProfessor of History of Science at Oxford University</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>",
