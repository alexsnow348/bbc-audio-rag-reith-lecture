  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the 1691 peace treaty that ended the Williamite War in Ireland, between supporters of the deposed King James II and the forces of William III and his allies.  It followed the battles at Aughrim and the Boyne and sieges at Limerick, and led to the disbanding of the Jacobite army in Ireland, with troops free to follow James to France for his Irish Brigade. The Catholic landed gentry were guaranteed rights on condition of swearing loyalty to William and Mary yet, while some Protestants thought the terms too lenient, it was said the victors broke those terms before the ink was dry.</p><p>The image above is from  British Battles on Land and Sea, Vol. I, by James Grant, 1880, and is meant to show Irish troops leaving Limerick as part of The Flight of the Wild Geese - a term used for soldiers joining continental European armies from C16th-C18th.</p><p>With </p><p>Jane Ohlmeyer\nChair of the Irish Research Council and Erasmus Smith’s Professor of Modern History at Trinity College Dublin</p><p>Dr Clare Jackson\nSenior Tutor, Trinity Hall, and Faculty of History, University of Cambridge</p><p>and </p><p>Thomas O'Connor\nProfessor of History at Maynooth University</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
