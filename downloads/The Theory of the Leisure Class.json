  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the most influential work of Thorstein Veblen (1857-1929). In 1899, during America’s Gilded Age, Veblen wrote The Theory of the Leisure Class as a reminder that all that glisters is not gold.  He picked on traits of the waning landed class of Americans and showed how the new moneyed class was adopting these in ways that led to greater waste throughout society. He called these conspicuous leisure and conspicuous consumption and he developed a critique of a system that favoured profits for owners without regard to social good.  The Theory of the Leisure Class was a best seller and funded Veblen for the rest of his life, and his ideas influenced the New Deal of the 1930s. Since then, an item that becomes more desirable as it becomes more expensive is known as a Veblen good. </p><p>With </p><p>Matthew Watson\nProfessor of Political Economy at the University of Warwick</p><p>Bill Waller\nProfessor of Economics at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, New York</p><p>And</p><p>Mary Wrenn\nSenior Lecturer in Economics at the University of the West of England</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>Reading list:</p><p>Charles Camic, Veblen: The Making of an Economist who Unmade Economics (Harvard University Press, 2021)</p><p>John P.
