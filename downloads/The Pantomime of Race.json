  "description": "<p>This year's Reith lecturer is Professor Patricia Williams, one of the most well known intellectuals in American law.  </p><p>In her second Reith lecture, Professor Patricia Williams explores how race related problems in society seem to be rendered invisible by 'colour blindness'. Using examples from American legal cases she analyses society's systemic denial of racial experiences. Discussing her expression 'racial voyeurism', she argues that all of these problems stem from racial and cultural domination. </p>",
