  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the last pagan ruler of the Roman Empire.  Fifty years after Constantine the Great converted to Christianity and introduced a policy of tolerating the faith across the empire, Julian (c.331 - 363 AD) aimed to promote paganism instead, branding Constantine the worst of all his predecessors.  Julian was a philosopher-emperor in the mould of Marcus Aurelius and was noted in his lifetime for his letters and his satires, and it was his surprising success as a general in his youth in Gaul that had propelled him to power barely twenty years after a rival had slaughtered his family.  Julian's pagan mission  and his life were brought to a sudden end while on campaign against the Sasanian Empire in the east, but he left so much written evidence of his ideas that he remains one of the most intriguing of all the Roman emperors and a hero to the humanists of the Enlightenment. </p><p>With </p><p>James Corke-Webster \nReader in Classics, History and Liberal Arts at King’s College, London</p><p>Lea Niccolai \nAssistant Professor in Classics at the University of Cambridge and Fellow and Director of Studies in Classics, Trinity College </p><p>And </p><p>Shaun Tougher\nProfessor of Late Roman and Byzantine History at Cardiff University</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>Reading list:</p><p>Polymnia Athanassiadi, Julian: An Intellectual Biography (first published 1981; Routledge, 2014)</p><p>Nicholas Baker-Brian and Shaun Tougher (eds.), Emperor and Author: The Writings of Julian the Apostate (Classical Press of Wales, 2012)</p><p>Nicholas Baker-Brian and Shaun Tougher (eds.), The Sons of Constantine, AD 337-361: In the Shadows of Constantine and Julian, (Palgrave Macmillan, 2020)</p><p>G.W.
