  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the life, ideas and legacy of the pioneering Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707 – 1778). The philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau once wrote: \"Tell him I know no greater man on earth\". </p><p>The son of a parson, Linnaeus grew up in an impoverished part of Sweden but managed to gain a place at university. He went on to transform biology by making two major innovations. He devised a simpler method of naming species and he developed a new system for classifying plants and animals, a system that became known as the Linnaean hierarchy. He was also one of the first people to grow a banana in Europe. </p><p>With</p><p>Staffan Muller-Wille\nUniversity Lecturer in History of Life, Human and Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge</p><p>Stella Sandford\nProfessor of Modern European Philosophy at Kingston University, London</p><p>and </p><p>Steve Jones \nSenior Research Fellow in Genetics at University College, London</p><p>Producer  Luke Mulhall</p>",
