  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the life and works of Emily Dickinson, arguably the most startling and original poet in America in the C19th. According to Thomas Wentworth Higginson, her correspondent and mentor, writing 15 years after her death, \"Few events in American literary history have been more curious than the sudden rise of Emily Dickinson into a posthumous fame only more accentuated by the utterly recluse character of her life and by her aversion to even a literary publicity.\" That was in 1891 and, as more of Dickinson's poems were published, and more of her remaining letters, the more the interest in her and appreciation of her grew. With her distinctive voice, her abundance, and her exploration of her private world, she is now seen by many as one of the great lyric poets. </p><p>With </p><p>Fiona Green\nSenior Lecturer in English at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of Jesus College</p><p>Linda Freedman\nLecturer in English and American Literature at University College London</p><p>and</p><p>Paraic Finnerty\nReader in English and American Literature at the University of Portsmouth</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>",
