  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the most destructive riots in London's history, which reached their peak on 7th June 1780 as troops fired on the crowd outside the Bank of England. The leader was Lord George Gordon, head of the Protestant Association, who objected to the relaxing of laws against Catholics. At first the protest outside Parliament was peaceful but, when Gordon's petition failed to persuade the Commons, rioting continued for days until the military started to shoot suspects in the street. It came as Britain was losing the war to hold on to colonies in North America.</p><p>The image above shows a crowd setting fire to Newgate Prison and freeing prisoners by the authority of 'His Majesty, King Mob.'</p><p>With</p><p>Ian Haywood\nProfessor of English at the University of Roehampton</p><p>Catriona Kennedy\nSenior Lecturer in Modern British and Irish History and Director of the Centre for Eighteenth Century Studies at the University of York</p><p>and </p><p>Mark Knights\nProfessor of History at the University of Warwick</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
