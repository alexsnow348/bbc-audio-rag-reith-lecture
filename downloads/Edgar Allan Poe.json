  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Poe (1809-1849), the American author who is famous for his Gothic tales of horror, madness and the dark interiors of the mind, such as The Fall of the House of Usher and The Tell-Tale Heart. As well as tapping at our deepest fears in poems such as The Raven, Poe pioneered detective fiction with his character C. Auguste Dupin in The Murders in the Rue Morgue. After his early death, a rival rushed out a biography to try to destroy Poe's reputation but he has only become more famous over the years as a cultural icon as well as an author.</p><p>With</p><p>Bridget Bennett\nProfessor of American Literature and Culture at the University of Leeds</p><p>Erin Forbes\nSenior Lecturer in 19th-century African American and US Literature at the University of Bristol</p><p>And</p><p>Tom Wright\nReader in Rhetoric at the University of Sussex</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>Reading list: </p><p>Peter Ackroyd, Poe: A Life Cut Short (Vintage, 2009)</p><p>Amy Branam Armiento and Travis Montgomery (eds.), Poe and Women: Recognition and Revision (Lehigh University Press, 2023)</p><p>Joan Dayan, Fables of Mind: An Inquiry into Poe's Fiction (Oxford University Press, 1987)</p><p>Erin Forbes, ‘Edgar Allan Poe in the Great Dismal Swamp’ (Modern Philology, 2016)</p><p>Kevin J.
