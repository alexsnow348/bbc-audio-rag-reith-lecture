  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and his guests begin a new series of the programme with a discussion of the French polymath Blaise Pascal. Born in 1623, Pascal was a brilliant mathematician and scientist, inventing one of the first mechanical calculators and making important discoveries about fluids and vacuums while still a young man. In his thirties he experienced a religious conversion, after which he devoted most of his attention to philosophy and theology. Although he died in his late thirties, Pascal left a formidable legacy as a scientist and pioneer of probability theory, and as one of seventeenth century Europe's greatest writers. </p><p>With:</p><p>David Wootton\nAnniversary Professor of History at the University of York</p><p>Michael Moriarty\nDrapers Professor of French at the University of Cambridge</p><p>Michela Massimi\nSenior Lecturer in the Philosophy of Science at the University of Edinburgh.</p><p>Producer: Thomas Morris.</p>",
