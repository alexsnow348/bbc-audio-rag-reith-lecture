  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the architect Sir John Soane (1753 -1837), the son of a bricklayer. He rose up the ranks of his profession as an architect to see many of his designs realised to great acclaim, particularly the Bank of England and the Law Courts at Westminster Hall, although his work on both of those has been largely destroyed. He is now best known for his house in Lincoln’s Inn Fields in London, which he remodelled and crammed with antiquities and artworks: he wanted visitors to experience the house as a dramatic grand tour of Europe in microcosm. He became professor of architecture at the Royal Academy, and in a series of influential lectures he set out his belief in the power of buildings to enlighten people about “the poetry of architecture”. Visitors to the museum and his other works can see his trademark architectural features such as his shallow dome, which went on to inspire Britain's red telephone boxes.</p><p>With: </p><p>Frances Sands, the Curator of Drawings and Books at Sir John Soane’s Museum</p><p>Frank Salmon, Associate Professor of the History of Art at the University of Cambridge and Director of the Ax:son Johnson Centre for the Study of Classical Architecture</p><p>And </p><p>Gillian Darley, historian and author of Soane's biography.</p><p>Producer: Eliane Glaser\nIn Our time is a BBC Studios Audio production.</p><p>Reading list:</p><p>Barry Bergdoll, European Architecture 1750-1890 (Oxford University Press, 2000)</p><p>Bruce Boucher, John Soane's Cabinet of Curiosities: Reflections on an Architect and His Collection (Yale University Press, 2024)</p><p>Oliver Bradbury, Sir John Soane’s Influence on Architecture from 1791: An Enduring Legacy (Routledge, 2015)</p><p>Gillian Darley, John Soane: An Accidental Romantic (Yale University Press, 1999)</p><p>Ptolemy Dean, Sir John Soane and the Country Estate (Ashgate, 1999)</p><p>Ptolemy Dean, Sir John Soane and London (Lund Humphries, 2006)</p><p>Helen Dorey, John Soane and J.M.W.
