  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908-1961), who was part of the movement known as phenomenology. While less well-known than his contemporaries Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, his popularity has increased among philosophers in recent years. Merleau-Ponty rejected Rene Descartes’ division between body and mind, arguing that the way we perceive the world around us cannot be separated from our experience of inhabiting a physical body. Merleau-Ponty was interested in the down-to-earth question of what it is actually like to live in the world. While performing actions as simple as brushing our teeth or patting a dog, we shape the world and, in turn, the world shapes us.\n \nWith </p><p>Komarine Romdenh-Romluc\nSenior Lecturer in Philosophy at the University of Sheffield</p><p>Thomas Baldwin\nEmeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of York</p><p>And </p><p>Timothy Mooney\nAssociate Professor of Philosophy at University College, Dublin</p><p>Produced by Eliane Glaser</p><p>Reading list:</p><p>Peter Antich, Motivation and the Primacy of Perception: Merleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of \nKnowledge (Ohio University Press, 2021)</p><p>Dimitris Apostolopoulos, Merleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of Language (Rowman and Littlefield, 2019) </p><p>Sarah Bakewell, At the Existentialist Café: Freedom, Being and Apricot Cocktails (Chatto and Windus, 2016) </p><p>Thomas Baldwin (ed.), Maurice Merleau-Ponty: Basic Writings (Routledge, 2004)</p><p>Thomas Baldwin (ed.), Reading Merleau-Ponty (Routledge, 2007)</p><p>Renaud Barbaras (trans.
