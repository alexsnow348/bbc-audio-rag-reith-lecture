  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the Austrian-born film director Fritz Lang (1890-1976), who was one of the most celebrated film-makers of the 20th century. He worked first in Weimar Germany, creating  a range of films including the startling and subversive Mabuse the Gambler and the iconic but ruinously expensive Metropolis before arguably his masterpiece, M, with both the police and the underworld hunting for a child killer in Berlin, his first film with sound. The rise of the Nazis prompted Lang's move to Hollywood where he developed some of his Weimar themes in memorable and disturbing films such as Fury and The Big Heat. </p><p>With </p><p>Stella Bruzzi\nProfessor of Film and Dean of Arts and Humanities at University College London</p><p>Joe McElhaney\nProfessor of Film Studies at Hunter College, City University of New York</p><p>And</p><p>Iris Luppa\nSenior Lecturer in Film Studies in the Division of Film and Media at London South Bank University</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
