  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the author and philosopher Iris Murdoch (1919 - 1999).  In her lifetime she was most celebrated for her novels such as The Bell and The Black Prince, but these are now sharing the spotlight with her philosophy.  Responding to the horrors of the Second World War, she argued that morality was not subjective or a matter of taste, as many of her contemporaries held, but was objective, and good was a fact we could recognize.  To tell good from bad, though, we would need to see the world as it really is, not as we want to see it, and her novels are full of characters who are not yet enlightened enough to do that.</p><p>With</p><p>Anil Gomes\nFellow and Tutor in Philosophy at Trinity College, University of Oxford</p><p>Anne Rowe\nVisiting Professor at the University of Chichester and Emeritus Research Fellow with the Iris Murdoch Archive Project at Kingston University</p><p>And</p><p>Miles Leeson\nDirector of the Iris Murdoch Research Centre and Reader in English Literature at the University of Chichester</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
