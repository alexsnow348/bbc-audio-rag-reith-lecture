  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Roman physician and medical theorist Galen. The most celebrated doctor in the ancient world, Galen was Greek by birth but spent most of his career in Rome, where he was personal physician to three Emperors. He was one of the most prolific authors of his age, and a sixth of all surviving ancient literature in Greek was written by him. Celebrated in his own lifetime, he was regarded as the preeminent medical authority for centuries after his death, both in the Arab world and in medieval Europe. It was only the discoveries of Renaissance science which removed Galen from his dominant position in the pantheon of medicine.</p><p>With:</p><p>Vivian Nutton\nEmeritus Professor of the History of Medicine at University College London</p><p>Helen King\nProfessor of Classical Studies at the Open University</p><p>Caroline Petit\nWellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow in Classics at the University of Warwick</p><p>Producer: Thomas Morris.</p>",
