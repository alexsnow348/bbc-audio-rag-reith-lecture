  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the philosophy of truth. Pontius Pilate famously asked: what is truth? In the twentieth century, the nature of truth became a subject of particular interest to philosophers, but they preferred to ask a slightly different question: what does it mean to say of any particular statement that it is true? What is the difference between these two questions, and how useful is the second of them?</p><p>With:</p><p>Simon Blackburn\nFellow of Trinity College, University of Cambridge, and Professor of Philosophy at the New College of the Humanities</p><p>Jennifer Hornsby\nProfessor of Philosophy at Birkbeck, University of London</p><p>Crispin Wright\nRegius Professor of Logic at the University of Aberdeen, and Professor of Philosophy at New York University</p><p>Producer: Victoria Brignell and Luke Mulhall.</p>",
