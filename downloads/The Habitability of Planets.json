  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss some of the great unanswered questions in science: how and where did life on Earth begin, what did it need to thrive and could it be found elsewhere? Charles Darwin speculated that we might look for the cradle of life here in 'some warm little pond'; more recently the focus moved to ocean depths, while new observations in outer space and in laboratories raise fresh questions about  the potential for lifeforms to develop and thrive, or 'habitability' as it is termed. What was the chemistry needed for life to begin and is it different from the chemistry we have now? With that in mind, what signs of life should we be looking for in the universe to learn if we are alone?</p><p>With </p><p>Jayne Birkby\nAssociate Professor of Exoplanetary Sciences at the University of Oxford and Tutorial Fellow in Physics at Brasenose College</p><p>Saidul Islam\nAssistant Professor of Chemistry at Kings College, London</p><p>And </p><p>Oliver Shorttle\nProfessor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Cambridge and Fellow of Clare College</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p><p>Reading list: </p><p>David Grinspoon, Venus Revealed: A New Look Below the Clouds of Our Mysterious Twin Planet (Basic Books, 1998)</p><p>Lisa Kaltenegger, Alien Earths: Planet Hunting in the Cosmos (Allen Lane, 2024)</p><p>Andrew H.
