  "title": "The Evolution of Lungs",
  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the evolution of lungs and of the first breaths, which can be traced back 400 million years to when animal life spread from rock pools and swamps onto land, as some fish found an evolutionary advantage in getting their oxygen from air rather than water. Breathing with lungs may have started with fish filling their mouths with air and forcing it down into sacs in their chests, like the buccal pumping that frogs do now, and slowly their swimming muscles adapted to work their lungs like bellows. </p><p>While lungs developed in different ways, there are astonishing continuities: for example, the distinct breathing system that helps tiny birds fly thousands of miles now is also the one that once allowed some dinosaurs to become huge; our hiccups are vestiges of the flight reaction in fish needing more oxygen; and we still breathe through our skins, just not enough to meet our needs.</p><p>With:</p><p>Steve Brusatte\nProfessor of Palaeontology and Evolution at the University of Edinburgh</p><p>Emily Rayfield\nProfessor of Palaeobiology at the University of Bristol</p><p>And</p><p>Jonathan Codd\nProfessor of Integrative Zoology at the University of Manchester</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson </p><p>Reading list:</p><p>Roger B.
