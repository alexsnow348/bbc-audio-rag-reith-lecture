  "description": "<p>French poet Jacques Darras delivers the first of his Reith Lectures entitled 'Beyond the Tunnel of History'.  Taking inspiration from the formation of the Channel Tunnel, Durras looks back through the shared history of France and Britain and suggests that their respective national pasts will need to be reinterpreted in the light of a shared future.\nIn his first lecture entitled 'The Time Traveller', Jacque Darras  asks the question, now that their destinies are increasingly converging within a wider Europe, how will the two cultures reconcile with each other? To answer this question he explores the embodiment of democracy within the civic squares of Europe. He uses the historic architectural landmarks to evaluate how France and Britain might still form a multicultural Europe. </p>",
