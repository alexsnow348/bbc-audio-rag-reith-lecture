  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the impact of David I of Scotland (c1084-1153) on his kingdom and on neighbouring lands.  The youngest son of Malcolm III, he was raised in exile in the Anglo-Norman court and became Earl of Huntingdon and Prince of Cumbria before claiming the throne in 1124. He introduced elements of what he had learned in England and, in the next decades, his kingdom saw new burghs, new monasteries, new ways of governing and the arrival of some very influential families, earning him the reputation of The Perfect King.</p><p>With </p><p>Richard Oram\nProfessor of Medieval and Environmental History at the University of Stirling</p><p>Alice Taylor\nProfessor of Medieval History at King’s College London</p><p>And</p><p>Alex Woolf\nSenior Lecturer in History at the University of St Andrews</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
