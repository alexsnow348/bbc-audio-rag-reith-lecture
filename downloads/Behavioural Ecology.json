  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Behavioural Ecology, the scientific study of animal behaviour.</p><p>What factors influence where and what an animal chooses to eat? Why do some animals mate for life whilst others are promiscuous? Behavioural ecologists approach questions like these using Darwin's theory of natural selection, along with ideas drawn from game theory and the economics of consumer choice.</p><p>Scientists had always been interested in why animals behave as they do, but before behavioural ecology this area of zoology never got much beyond a collection of interesting anecdotes. Behavioural ecology gave researchers techniques for constructing rigorous mathematical models of how animals act under different circumstances, and for predicting how they will react if circumstances change. Behavioural ecology emerged as a branch of zoology in the second half of the 20th century and proponents say it revolutionized our understanding of animals in their environments.</p><p>GUESTS</p><p>Steve Jones, Emeritus Professor of Genetics at University College London</p><p>Rebecca Kilner, Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of Cambridge</p><p>John Krebs, Principal of Jesus College at the University of Oxford</p><p>Producer: Luke Mulhall.</p>",
