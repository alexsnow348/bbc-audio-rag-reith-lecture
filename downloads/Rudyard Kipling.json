  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the life and work of Rudyard Kipling. Born in Bombay in 1865, Kipling has been described as the poet of Empire, celebrated for fictional works including Kim and The Jungle Book. Today his poem 'If--' remains one of the best known in the English language. Kipling was amongst the first writers in English to develop the short story as a literary form in its own right, and was the first British recipient of a Nobel Prize for Literature. A literary celebrity of the Edwardian era, Kipling's work for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission played a major role in Britain's cultural response to the First World War.</p><p>Contributors:</p><p>Howard Booth, Senior Lecturer in English Literature at the University of Manchester</p><p>Daniel Karlin, Winterstoke Professor of English Literature at the University of Bristol</p><p>Jan Montefiore, Professor of Twentieth Century English Literature at the University of Kent</p><p>Producer: Luke Mulhall.</p>",
