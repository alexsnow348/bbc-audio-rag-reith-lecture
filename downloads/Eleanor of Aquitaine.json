  "title": "Eleanor of Aquitaine",
  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the life, times and influence of Eleanor of Aquitaine (c1122-1204) who was one of the most powerful women in Twelfth Century Europe, possibly in the entire Middle Ages. She inherited land from the Loire down to the Pyrenees, about a third of modern France. She married first the King of France, Louis VII, joining him on the Second Crusade. She became stronger still after their marriage was annulled, as her next husband, Henry Plantagenet became Henry II of England. Two of their sons, Richard and John, became kings and she ruled for them when they were abroad. By her death in her eighties, Eleanor had children and grandchildren in power across western Europe. This led to competing claims of inheritance and, for much of the next 250 years, the Plantagenet and French kings battled over Eleanor's land.</p><p>With</p><p>Lindy Grant\nProfessor of Medieval History at the University of Reading</p><p>Nicholas Vincent\nProfessor of Medieval History at the University of East Anglia</p><p>And</p><p>Julie Barrau\nUniversity Lecturer in British Medieval History at the University of Cambridge</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson.</p>",
