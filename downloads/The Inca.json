  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss how the people of Cusco, in modern Peru, established an empire along the Andes down to the Pacific under their supreme leader Pachacuti.  Before him, their control grew slowly  from C13th and was at its peak after him when Pizarro arrived with his Conquistadors and captured their empire for Spain in 1533. The image, above, is of Machu Picchu which was built for emperor Pachacuti as an estate in C15th. </p><p>With </p><p>Frank Meddens\nVisiting Scholar at the University of Reading</p><p>Helen Cowie\nSenior Lecturer in History at the University of York</p><p>And</p><p>Bill Sillar\nSenior Lecturer at the Institute of Archaeology at University College London</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
