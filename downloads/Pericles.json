  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Pericles  (495-429BC), the statesman who dominated the politics of Athens for thirty years, the so-called Age of Pericles, when the city’s cultural life flowered, its democracy strengthened as its empire grew, and the Acropolis was adorned with the Parthenon.  In 431 BC he gave a funeral oration for those Athenians who had already died in the new war with Sparta which has been celebrated as one of the greatest speeches of all time, yet within two years he was dead from a plague made worse by Athenians crowding into their city to avoid attacks. Thucydides, the historian, knew him and was in awe of him, yet few shared that view until the nineteenth century, when they found much in Pericles to praise, an example for the Victorian age. </p><p>With </p><p>Edith Hall\nProfessor of Classics at King's College London.</p><p>Paul Cartledge\nAG Leventis Senior Research Fellow at Clare College, University of Cambridge</p><p>And </p><p>Peter Liddel\nSenior Lecturer in Ancient History at the University of Manchester</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
