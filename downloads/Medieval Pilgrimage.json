  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the idea and experience of Christian pilgrimage in Europe from the 12th to the 15th centuries, which figured so strongly in the imagination of the age. For those able and willing to travel, there were countless destinations from Jerusalem, Rome and Santiago de Compostela to the smaller  local shrines associated with miracles and relics of the saints.  Meanwhile, for those unable or not allowed to travel there were journeys of the mind, inspired by guidebooks that would tell the faithful how many steps they could take around their homes to replicate the walk to the main destinations in Rome and the Holy Land, passing paintings of the places on their route. </p><p>The image above is of a badge of St Thomas of Canterbury, worn by pilgrims who had journeyed to his shrine.</p><p>With</p><p>Miri Rubin\nProfessor of Medieval and Early Modern History at Queen Mary, University of London</p><p>Kathryn Rudy\nProfessor of Art History at the University of St Andrews</p><p>And</p><p>Anthony Bale\nProfessor of Medieval Studies and Dean of the School of Arts at Birkbeck, University of London</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
