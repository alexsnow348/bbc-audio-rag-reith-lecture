  "description": "<p>In a programme first broadcast in November 2018, Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the Austrian princess Maria Antonia, child bride of the future French King Louis XVI.  Their marriage was an attempt to bring about a major change in the balance of power in Europe and to undermine the influence of Prussia and Great Britain, but she had no say in the matter and was the pawn of her mother, the Empress Maria Theresa. She fulfilled her allotted role of supplying an heir, but was sent to the guillotine in 1793 in the French Revolution, a few months after her husband, following years of attacks on her as a woman who, it was said, betrayed the King and as a foreigner who betrayed France to enemy powers. When not doing these wrongs, she was said to be personally bankrupting France. Her death shocked royal families throughout Europe, and she became a powerful symbol of the consequences of the Revolution. </p><p>With </p><p>Catriona Seth\nMarshal Foch Professor of French Literature at the University of Oxford</p><p>Katherine Astbury\nProfessor of French Studies at the University of Warwick</p><p>and</p><p>David McCallam\nReader in French Eighteenth-Century Studies at the University of Sheffield</p><p>Producer: Simon Tillotson</p>",
