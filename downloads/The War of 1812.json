  "description": "<p>Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the War of 1812, the conflict between America and the British Empire sometimes referred to as the second American War of Independence. In June 1812, President James Madison declared war on Britain, angered by the restrictions Britain had imposed on American trade, the Royal Navy's capture of American sailors and British support for Native Americans. After three years of largely inconclusive fighting, the conflict finally came to an end with the Treaty of Ghent which, among other things, helped to hasten the abolition of the global slave trade.\n \nAlthough the War of 1812 is often overlooked, historians say it had a profound effect on the USA and Canada's sense of national identity, confirming the USA as an independent country. America's national anthem, The Star-Spangled Banner began life as a poem written after its author, Francis Scott Key, witnessed the British bombardment of Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore. The war also led to Native Americans losing hundreds of thousands of acres of land in a programme of forced removal.\n \nWith:\n \nKathleen Burk\nProfessor of Modern and Contemporary History at University College London\n \nLawrence Goldman\nFellow in Modern History at St Peter's College, University of Oxford\n \nFrank Cogliano\nProfessor of American History at the University of Edinburgh\n \nProducer: Victoria Brignell.</p>",
